  "Collaborate in the design of slogans/taglines": {
    "Answer:": "With the right slogan, you can make people giggle at a pun, ponder the mysteries of the universe, or even experience a powerful craving. A poor slogan, on the other hand, risks making customers cringe and unwilling to put money towards the product/service you offer.\nMake your slogan ABC: Ambitious But Credible\n\nAppeal to emotional needs\nMaking a purchase is often an emotional experience. If a slogan can incite a strong positive emotion (think joy, excitement, sympathy, etc.), it can better connect people with the products and services that aim to fill those needs.\n\nFor example, when Kleenex launched a video ad about a boy who gives tissues to a girl he spots crying on the school bus, the closing observation that \"someone needs one\" positioned Kleenexes as the universal response to tears everywhere. \n\nQuestions to consider about your slogan: \n• What emotions does it invoke? \n• Which of my target audience's needs relate to my slogan? \n\nStand out with clever wordplay\nYour slogan should be eye-catching and clever enough to make most readers think about it for a minute or two, making it more likely that they'll remember it. If it's too complicated, however, it can go right over their heads and leave them confused. There's no easy way to come up with a clever saying, but you can start by listing words that have to do with your product, then searching for rhymes, synonyms, and alternate definitions for puns. \n\nThose aren't the only ways to make your slogan stand out. Sounding too catchy in a clichéd way can also be counterproductive. Avoid this by avoiding clichés and superlatives. If people can sarcastically cite your slogan to disprove it when they experience setbacks, you've probably crossed the line between catchy and corny. \nReese's \"two great tastes that taste great together\" follows an A-B-B-A structure that, intentionally or not, imitates the peanut butter-filled structure of the candy itself. Your slogan does not have to be complicated for it to sound good. For example, \"Ace is the place with the helpful hardware folks\" is both easy on the tongue and straightforward, similar to the down-to-earth nature of hardware stores. \n\nPhrases such as \"We do X, so you don't have to.\", \"For x, by x.\" and \"X of the future\" are all used so frequently that consumers are used to tuning them out. If you want to express the sentiment embodied in these phrases, find a unique way of doing so. \n\nSome key questions to consider are:\n• Are consumers likely to understand the slogans wordplay? \n• Does the cleverness of the slogan distract from or reinforce its overall message and effect? \n• In what ways is my slogan different from most slogans?\n• In what ways is it similar to other slogans? \n• Are customers likely to roll their eyes at my slogan?\n\nMaintain a strong connection to your business\nA slogan should strongly relate to the product it promotes. If it doesn't, it might catch people's attention momentarily, but it won't stay with them. It's best if there's a solid and exciting link between your slogan and your product. For instance, Aquafina's insistence that their water is \"for happy bodies\" makes sense. Sunchips' claim to be \"unique in every wave\" distinguishes their chips from their differently-shaped competitors. Finally, Paper & Packaging Board's assertion that their products are at the heart of \"how life unfolds.\" would not make much sense for a business centered on different values, such as a burger place."

    "Answer:": "Investing is the act of allocating funds or committing capital to an asset, like stocks, with the expectation of generating an income or profit. The anticipation of a return on payment is the core premise of investing.

  "Compare the costs of post-secondary education with the potential increase in income from a career of choice": {
    "Answer:": "Post-secondary education, which includes programs such as college, university, and technical or vocational schools, can be a significant financial investment. The cost of post-secondary education can vary widely depending on factors such as the type of institution, the program of study, and the location. Some common costs associated with post-secondary education include tuition, fees, books, and living expenses.\n\nThe potential increase in income that a person may experience after completing a post-secondary education program depends on a variety of factors, including the type of career they choose, their level of education, and their experience and skills. Generally, people with a post-secondary education tend to earn more than those without one. According to data from the U.S. Census Bureau, the median earnings of workers with a bachelor's degree were $65,482 in 2019, compared to $39,802 for those with a high school diploma. However, it's important to note that this is just a general trend and does not necessarily apply to every individual or every career.\n\nIt's also important to consider the potential long-term benefits of post-secondary education beyond just increased income. For example, post-secondary education may open up new career opportunities and increase job security, as employers often prefer to hire workers with higher levels of education. Post-secondary education may also lead to personal and professional growth and development.\n\nOverall, the costs of post-secondary education should be carefully considered in relation to the potential increase in income and other potential benefits that a person may experience as a result of their education."

    "Answer:": "Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) are both sets of accounting standards that provide guidelines for financial reporting. However, there are some key differences between the two:\n\nOrigin: GAAP is developed and issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) in the United States, whereas IFRS is developed and issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).\n\nCoverage: GAAP applies specifically to the United States, whereas IFRS is used in more than 100 countries around the world.\n\nApproach: GAAP is based on a principles-based approach, which means that it provides general guidelines and leaves room for judgment in applying the principles. IFRS is based on a rules-based approach, which provides more specific guidance and leaves less room for judgment.\n\nDisclosure requirements: GAAP has more detailed disclosure requirements than IFRS, which may result in longer and more complex financial statements.\n\nConvergence: In recent years, the FASB and IASB have been working towards convergence, or the alignment, of GAAP and IFRS. However, there are still some significant differences between the two standards.\n\nOverall, while GAAP and IFRS have some similarities, they are developed by different organizations and have some key differences in terms of their origin, coverage, approach, and disclosure requirements."

  "Defend ideas objectively": {
    "Answer:": "When someone criticizes or challenges you, your self-confidence can falter. You may feel the need either to defend yourself or to agree and give in. Neither choice is good for your career or business. You don’t want to get a reputation for being stubborn and hot-headed or weak and submissive. \nStart by being prepared to address objections and answer questions. When it happens, keep the result you want in mind. Focus on: \n• what you are trying to achieve \n• what is best for the organization or your client \n• the value of your idea or opinion for achieving the result \n• the value of the feedback on the result \nRemember to maintain a growth mindset. People with a growth mindset see setbacks as opportunities to learn and grow. This will serve you well in situations where you feel as if you are being attacked or unfairly criticized. The key is to pause, reflect on what is being said, and be willing to take the other person’s point of view as valid and worth considering. This immediately reduces the risk of responding negatively. \nKeep in mind that others may not exercise restraint and may become angry or defensive when you pursue your ideas. Don’t let them push your buttons. Maintain a calm attitude, and continue to communicate in a polite, reasonable manner. \nYou may have to take a break or table the discussion. Do so with grace and firmness. Say something like, “I need to think about what you are saying. Why don’t we take a break and get back together later?” By listening to others without judgment, you may discover that their arguments have merit. They may, in fact, lead you to change your ideas or opinions. This is good news. Your willingness to improve your idea or accept something better is the mark of a growth mindset. But there’s another benefit: This openness is a sign of professionalism and leadership. \nYou will gain the respect of others and become someone they want to work with and be around. You will be taken more seriously when people know you can accept and appropriately respond to feedback. All of this can boost your self-confidence. You will be listened to and respected—even by people who disagree with you. Hearing negative, critical feedback and staying calm isn’t easy. You may have to use mental rehearsal more on this aspect of communication in order to master it. It is worth the effort. Your ability to defend your ideas without becoming defensive helps you face challenges more easily. Each time you face a challenge and succeed, you gain more confidence."

  "Define the time value of money and explain how money invested regularly over time may grow exponentially": {
    "Answer:": "• The time value of money draws from the idea that rational investors prefer to receive money today rather than the same amount of money in the future because of money's potential to grow at a rate of interest over a given period of time. For example, a deposit earning a certain interest rate each month will improve in value as long as the rate of inflation is lower than the interest rate. \n• Whenever possible, choose an investment that compounds because this means interest will be paid on the interest. The more frequently the compounding occurs, the more quickly the money amasses. \n• The rule of 72 is a shortcut to estimate the number of years required to double your money at a given annual rate of return. Years required to double investment = 72 ÷ compound annual interest rate."

  "Demonstrate a customer-service mindset": {
    "Answer:": "Providing the perfect customer experience (CX) is no easy task and yet studies suggest that there’s a strong link between CX and customer loyalty. \nOf course, CX is a sum of its parts, of which there are many, and probably the most important of these is the way that your customers are treated by service staff. For those on the front line, it can be difficult to discover and maintain a positive mindset at all times – customers can be rude, even abusive if they become frustrated. This can be easily overcome though, it’s just a case of having the right mindset. \nPut Yourself in Their Shoes: Customers are just people like any other and for a customer service rep to be effective, they should have a certain amount of empathy. This means that you should train staff firstly how to listen effectively and how to pick up signals from the customer to inform the response. This isn’t as difficult as it sounds. As human beings we’re all accustomed to picking up signals from others on a daily basis. \nAnger and frustration are of course the easiest to pick up. You should train staff to listen carefully to what the customer has to say, without interrupting, to gain a full understanding of their issue. \nBuild Relationships: A good customer service rep doesn’t approach conversation with a customer as a problem, but as an opportunity. With this in mind, encourage staff to think about customers as they would be somebody they know. This means that the rep should: \n• Offer a solution to the problem that the customer has \n• Be friendly, informal and listen to what each individual customer has to say\n• Be natural and not read from a script \n• Allow the customer to lead in terms of how they are addressed (sir, madam, first names, surnames.) • Not offer empty platitudes or ignore what they have to say \nBe Generous: Good customer service springs from a place where the business is secure and its employees can afford to be generous in terms of the time they give, the approachability of their staff and that there’s plenty to share – train your staff to know exactly what they can give when a complaint/return/refund request comes their way. \nCustomer service is a tough job and it’s not particularly easy to get everything right. However, promoting and fostering a positive mindset is vital and to do this, it’s necessary to put the right training in place and to ensure that the workforce is happy overall. A happy worker is one that’s much more inclined to show the empathy that good customer service needs so it’s up to you, the business owner, to ensure that you create the right environment for your staff to carry out their job effectively.  \n\nOR \nCustomer service personnel are the first, and maybe only, contact with the company so it is essential for these employees to convey the brand image and ensure that the customer’s experience is stellar. The essence of good customer service is building a relationship with customers – a relationship that that individual customer feels that he would like to pursue. Good customer service is all about bringing customers back. And about sending them away happy - happy enough to pass positive feedback about your business along to others, who may then try the product or service you offer for themselves and in their turn become repeat customers. \n\nSome aspects of good customer service are: \n• Thorough employee training \n• Exemplary customer orientation – reliability, assurance, consistency, empathy, responsiveness \n• Exceeding expectations \n• Present an attitude of valuing the customer and offering a consistently helpful, can-do service experience \n• Be consistently friendly and helpful in every means of communication (phone and online) \n• Build/pursue a professional personal and/or emotional connection to build loyalty \n• Be extremely well-informed about all aspects of the company and its products and services \n\nOR \nA service mindset is an outlook that focuses on creating customer value, loyalty and trust. A business with this outlook wants to go beyond simply providing a product or service. It wants to create a positive and indelible imprint in the customer's, or even in the prospect's mind. To do this, a business has to care about the customer or prospect experience and work continuously at enhancing it. \n• Listen carefully to the customer's complaint and acknowledge that you are there to help—in this case that the business meeting has been disrupted \nYou know you have a customer-service mindset if you: \n• Talk about positive customer interactions more than negative \n• You view negative customer interactions as opportunities to learn even more about the customers' needs and expectations• you create opportunities for customer contact\n• Building loyalty and customer relationships"

  "Describe common management accounting performance measures (e.g., balanced scorecard, return on investment [ROI],customer profitability analysis, etc.) ": {
    "Answer:": "A performance measurement is a numeric outcome of an analysis that indicates how well an organization is achieving its objectives. These measurements can be used to examine the performance of all aspects of a business, including the accounting, engineering, finance, marketing, materials management, production, research, and sales departments. Examples of performance measurements are: \n● Tracking the ability of the accounting department to collect overdue accounts receivable \n● Tracking the speed with which the engineering department can design new products \n● Tracking the liquidity of funds administered by the finance department \n● Tracking the amount of inventory maintained by the materials management department \n● Tracking the amount of scrap produced in the production department \n● Tracking the ability of the sales staff to bring in new sales from existing customers \nPerformance measurements are typically compiled into a summary sheet that is distributed to the management team on a regular basis. Any measures falling below a trend line or not meeting a predetermined standard will be subject to enhanced management attention. \nAnother form of performance measurement is the use of revenue centers, profit centers, and cost centers to report the results of business segments. A revenue center is responsible solely for the amount of revenue it generates, while a profit center is responsible for both the revenues it generates and the costs it incurs. A cost center is only responsible for the costs it incurs. Nearly all parts of a business can be broken down into one of these classifications"

  "Describe considerations in using databases in marketing communications.": {
    "Answer:": "Databases can be used to collect social media handles, phone numbers, email addresses, as well as demographic, geographic, and psychographic data to segment a market and identify potential contacts for promotional campaigns. Having been around since the 1980s, database marketing is nothing new. However, due to the recent data explosion where the amount of information and the number of sources it is being obtained from have increased to unprecedented levels; the possibilities its effective use provides are becoming ever more fruitful. \nIn fact, a survey conducted by data governance experts the DQM group has revealed that 53% of the 144 UK based organisations polled planned to increase their level of investment in data and marketing during 2013. But what is database marketing and what factors are driving this new found enthusiasm for its use? \nWhat is database marketing? \nDatabase marketing is the process of identifying, collecting and then analyzing relevant information about a company’s customers. The database is compiled using data obtained from a range of internal and external sources such as sales information, email correspondence, warranty cards, promotional efforts and, now more than ever, social media. The primary aim of database marketing is to then use the information within the database to implement marketing strategies that ultimately increases profits. \n\nThe key driving force behind database marketing is establishing, building and then maintains a relationship with the customer. Developing and understanding how customer relationships work with database marketing can be instrumental in boosting customer retention levels and therefore profits through repeat custom, as well as amassing new customers. The three main stages of effective database marketing \n· Data collection – relates to the aggregation of accurate and relevant data about both existing and potential customers, and then ensuring the data is made available in such a way as it available for use by the company’s marketers in their related activities. \n· Turning data into knowledge – requires analyzing the data so that it becomes data which can be used in effective marketing and communications. For many businesses this involves using the information to segment existing and potential customers so that targeted and appropriate marketing message can be created for existing and potential customers. \n• Developing and evolving business strategies – involves using the data and the knowledge within a database for shaping the strategy of the business. For example, modifying company communications, the allocation of resources, pricing and other concerns that will aid long-term profit in line with the information gathered. \nThe benefits of database marketing \n· • Improved profitability – database marketing allows a business to segment and target its marketing efforts in a cost effective manner, whilst improving efficiency and profit margins. \n· • Increase sales – effective database marketing creates more sales by providing information that allows companies to identify and exploit new market opportunities, as well as attracting new customers. \n· • Improves marketing communications – accurate data increases the quality level of communications with customers’ existing and potential, allowing a company to massively improve its chances of building lasting customer relationships. · • Improve product development – with the successful implementation of a customer database, a business will be able to gather regular and up-to-date information that can be used as market research to identify where improvements can be made and where customer needs are not being met. This information can then be used in product development through by integrating conclusions derived from the research into the design of a new product. \nExamples of when and how it’s used \nThe information collated and stored on customer databases is used in a vast majority of ways. Here are four of the most common: \n· • Calculating customer lifetime value (CLTV) – is a prediction model used in marketing that can estimate what the lifetime relationship of an individual customer will be worth to a business. The accuracy of this model and the calculations involved have become a lot more accurate as the methods involved in database marketing have improved. \n· • Recency, Frequency, Monetary Analysis (RFM) – a marketing technique that is used to calculate the best customers of a business based on a triumvirate of factors; how recently a customer made a purchase, how frequent they purchase and how much they spend. The theory that drives the technique’s use is the marketing paradigm that 80% of your business \ncomes from 20% of your customers. This allows the efforts of the direct marketers to be specifically targeted to the best 20% of customers. Again, like CLTV, the accuracy of this technique has improved as database marketing has. · • Customer communications – an example of how database marketing improves customer communications include using information to personalize correspondence, making it easier to build up a rapport and, therefore, increase loyalty, customer retention and sales. Email, despite the perceptions of spam, has become an essential ancillary weapon in the toolkit of the database marketer, providing the means with which to instantly communicate with customers. · Analytical Software – increasingly businesses need to monitor their customers’ behaviour across an ever more varied number of retail channels, including websites, mobile apps and social media. Analytical software that is combined with their database can be used to synthesize this information more easily and produce instant reports that help define a company's marketing strategies."

  "Describe data mining tools and techniques.": {
    "Answer:": "The Data Mining implementation process in detail \nBusiness understanding: In this phase, business and data-mining goals are established. \n● First, you need to understand business and client objectives. You need to define what your client wants (which many times even they do not know themselves) \n● Take stock of the current data mining scenario. Factor in resources, assumption, constraints, and other significant factors into your assessment. \n● Using business objectives and current scenario, define your data mining goals. \n● A good data mining plan is very detailed and should be developed to accomplish both business and data mining goals. Data understanding: In this phase, sanity check on data is performed to check whether its appropriate for the data mining goals.\n\n● First, data is collected from multiple data sources available in the organization. \n● These data sources may include multiple databases, flat filer or data cubes. There are issues like object matching and schema integration which can arise during Data Integration process. It is a quite complex and tricky process as data from various sources unlikely to match easily. For example, table A contains an entity named cust_no whereas another table B contains an entity named cust-id. \n● Therefore, it is quite difficult to ensure that both of these given objects refer to the same value or not. Here, Metadata should be used to reduce errors in the data integration process. \n● Next, the step is to search for properties of acquired data. A good way to explore the data is to answer the data mining questions (decided in business phase) using the query, reporting, and visualization tools. \n● Based on the results of query, the data quality should be ascertained. Missing data if any should be acquired. Data preparation: In this phase, data is made production ready. \nThe data preparation process consumes about 90% of the time of the project. \nThe data from different sources should be selected, cleaned, transformed, formatted, anonymized, and constructed (if required). \nData cleaning is a process to \"clean\" the data by smoothing noisy data and filling in missing values. \nFor example, for a customer demographics profile, age data is missing. The data is incomplete and should be filled. In some cases, there could be data outliers. For instance, age has a value 300. Data could be inconsistent. For instance, name of the customer is different in different tables.\n\nData transformation operations change the data to make it useful in data mining. Following transformation can be applied \nData transformation: Data transformation operations would contribute toward the success of the mining process. Smoothing: It helps to remove noise from the data. \nAggregation: Summary or aggregation operations are applied to the data. I.e., the weekly sales data is aggregated to calculate the monthly and yearly total. \nGeneralization: In this step, Low-level data is replaced by higher-level concepts with the help of concept hierarchies. For example, the city is replaced by the county. \nNormalization: Normalization performed when the attribute data are scaled up o scaled down. Example: Data should fall inthe range -2.0 to 2.0 post-normalization. \nAttribute construction: these attributes are constructed and included the given set of attributes helpful for data mining. The result of this process is a final data set that can be used in modeling. \nModelling In this phase, mathematical models are used to determine data patterns. \n· Based on the business objectives, suitable modeling techniques should be selected for the prepared dataset. · Create a scenario to test check the quality and validity of the model. \n· Run the model on the prepared dataset. \n· Results should be assessed by all stakeholders to make sure that model can meet data mining objectives. Evaluation: In this phase, patterns identified are evaluated against the business objectives.\n\n· Results generated by the data mining model should be evaluated against the business objectives. · Gaining business understanding is an iterative process. In fact, while understanding, new business requirements may be raised because of data mining. \n· A go or no-go decision is taken to move the model in the deployment phase. \nDeployment: In the deployment phase, you ship your data mining discoveries to everyday business operations. · The knowledge or information discovered during data mining process should be made easy to understand for non technical stakeholders. \n· A detailed deployment plan, for shipping, maintenance, and monitoring of data mining discoveries is created. · A final project report is created with lessons learned and key experiences during the project. This helps to improve the organization's business policy. \nData Mining Techniques \nClassification: This analysis is used to retrieve important and relevant information about data, and metadata. This data mining method helps to classify data in different classes. \nClustering: Clustering analysis is a data mining technique to identify data that are like each other. This process helps to understand the differences and similarities between the data. \nRegression: Regression analysis is the data mining method of identifying and analyzing the relationship between variables. It is used to identify the likelihood of a specific variable, given the presence of other variables. \nAssociation Rules: This data mining technique helps to find the association between two or more Items. It discovers a hidden pattern in the data set. \nOuter detection: This type of data mining technique refers to observation of data items in the dataset which do not match an expected pattern or expected behavior. This technique can be used in a variety of domains, such as intrusion, detection, fraud or fault detection, etc. Outer detection is also called Outlier Analysis or Outlier mining.\n\nSequential Patterns: This data mining technique helps to discover or identify similar patterns or trends in transaction data for certain period. \nPrediction: Prediction has used a combination of the other data mining techniques like trends, sequential patterns, clustering, classification, etc. It analyzes past events or instances in a right sequence for predicting a future event. Challenges of Implementation of Data mine: \n· Skilled Experts are needed to formulate the data mining queries. \n· Overfitting: Due to small size training database, a model may not fit future states. \n· Data mining needs large databases which sometimes are difficult to manage \n· Business practices may need to be modified to determine to use the information uncovered. \n· If the data set is not diverse, data mining results may not be accurate. \n· Integration information needed from heterogeneous databases and global information systems could be complex"

  "Describe ethical considerations in channel management": {
    "Answer:": "As an owner of a business, the danger of crippling litigation should be at the top of your priorities. Legal headaches can take you by surprise and severely hurt your business’s bottom line. Ethical standards also require that employees and customers are not put in a situation where they might be at risk of harm as a result of their participation. Harm can be defined as both physical and psychological. \nThe major factors that can cause ethical problems in the workplace are: \n• lack of integrity, where employees do not embrace fairness and honesty in the workplace. \n• organizational relationship problems, which is when a company’s mission, goals, and objectives are not stated clearly. For the most part, companies are legally free to develop whatever channel arrangements suit them. In fact, the law seeks to prevent companies from using exclusionary tactics that might keep competitors from using a channel. Here we consider the legality of certain practices, including exclusive dealing, exclusive territories, tying agreements, and dealers’ rights. Exclusive dealing is a strategy in which the seller allows only certain outlets to carry its products is called exclusive distribution, and when the seller requires that these dealers not handle competitors’ products, this is called exclusive dealing. Both parties benefit from exclusive arrangements: The seller obtains more loyal and dependable outlets, and the dealers obtain a steady source of supply of special products and stronger seller support. Exclusive arrangements are legal as long as (1) they do not substantially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly, and (2) both parties have voluntarily entered into the agreement. Basic ethical principles are: \n• Respecting autonomy. The individual has the right to act as a free agent. … \n• Doing no harm (Nonmaleficence) Our interactions with people (within the helping professions or otherwise) should not harm others. … \n• Benefiting others (Beneficence) … \n• Being just (Justice) …\n• Being faithful (Fidelity) \nEthical standards are based on the human principles of right and wrong. The differences between them are these: Legal standardsare based on written law, while ethical standards are based on human rights and wrongs. Something can be legal but not ethical."

Anytime an employee accidentally spills a glass of milk, shrinkage is occurring.\n\nAn inventory control system is whatever the organization puts in place to help it keep track of goods. This will include twoaspects: \n1. determining if anything is missing and when and how it likely happened \n2. instituting measures to prevent the loss.  \nTraditionally, companies have relied on the honesty of its managers, employees, and customers, but where necessary, haveinstituted procedures that involve people filling out paperwork at all stages of handling and someone like a manager oraccountant will be responsible for making sure all paperwork matches. Modern inventory control systems are almostexclusively based on barcode technology. Though barcodes were initially developed to automate the process of grocery storecheckout, their ability to encode a wide variety of alphabetic and numeric symbols makes them ideal for encoding merchandisefor inventory applications. Inventory control systems work in real-time using wireless technology to transmit information to acentral computer system as transactions occur"

Because it’s money spent on individuals who are leaving the organization, outplacement might seem like an unnecessary expense. However, career transition services are often as advantageous to employers as they are to employees and worth the added investment. \n\nBusinesses that offer them can:\n• Improve their reputation. Sending the message that an employer cares about its people may lessen negative feedback when layoffs are announced. Businesses that are viewed favorably in the public also typically have a better chance of recruiting talent in the future.\n• Mitigate the risk of employee backlash. Employees are commonly frustrated when they are laid off or fired. Knowing that their former employer is going to help them get another job may reduce the chance of workplace violence or a wrongful termination lawsuit.\n• Boost employee morale by improving communication. Employers who clearly explain that career assistance services were made available to any employees who were let go may help ease anxiety among the remaining workers and keep them engaged.\n• Reduce unemployment costs. The faster former employees find new jobs, the less they will need unemployment benefits. Businesses that reduce their number of claims per year may be eligible for lower unemployment insurance rates.\n\nSource: https://www.adp.ca/en/resources/articles-and-insights/articles/o/outplacement-what-is-it-and-what-are-its-benefits.aspx"

  "Describe the determinants of exchange rates and their effects on the domestic economy.": {
    "Answer:": "Exchange rates are the price of one country's currency expressed in terms of another country's currency. The determinants of exchange rates include economic, political, and psychological factors that can affect the supply and demand of a country's currency in the foreign exchange market.\n\n• Interest Rates - Higher interest rates can make a country's currency more attractive to foreign investors, leading to an appreciation of the value of the currency or increase in the value of one currency in relation to another\n• Inflation - Higher inflation can lead to the depreciation in the value of a country's currency as it reduces the purchasing power of the currency\n• Trade Balance - As foreign demand for the country's currency increases, a country with a trade surplus (exporting more goods and services than it imports) will have a stronger currency. A country with a trade deficit (importing more than it exports) will tend to have a weaker currency.\n• Government Debt - A country with high levels of government debt may see its currency depreciate as investors perceive the country as being at risk for default (have poor credit rating and limited cash flow)\n• Political Instability - Can lead to a depreciation in the value of a country's currency as investors may view the country as being less stable and attractive for investment\n• Market Sentiment - If investors have a positive view of a country's economy, they are more likely to buy the country's currency, leading to an appreciation in its value. Negative sentiment can lead to the depreciation of the value of the currency.\n\nThe effects of exchange rates on the domestic economy can be significant. A depreciation in the value of a country's currency can make exports more competitive as they will be cheaper for foreign buyers. This can increase exports and boost the domestic economy. However, a depreciation can also lead to higher import prices as foreign goods will be more expensive for domestic consumers. This can lead to higher inflation and reduced purchasing power for domestic consumers."

  "Describe the economic impact of inflation on a business.": {
    "Answer:": "Inflation is the increase in the general price level of goods and services in an economy over a period of time. The economic impact is complex, depending on the level of inflation, the nature of the business, and the business's ability to adjust to changing economic conditions.\n\n• Reduce Customer Purchasing Power - When prices rise, consumers have less disposable income to spend on goods and services, which can lead to a decrease in demand, sales, and profit\n• Increase Costs - As the price of goods and services rise, businesses will pay more for the resources required to produce their products (e.g. raw materials, labor). This can lead to higher production costs, passed on to consumers as higher prices.\n• Reduce Costs for Business - Inflation can benefit businesses with fixed costs (e.g. rent, loan payments). A rise in inflation reduces the real value of these costs, making it easier for the business to afford them. \n• Bulk Shopping - Consumers may purchase items before prices rise further, leading to higher demand, sales, and profit"

  "Describe the nature and scope of the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) food safety management system.": {
    "Answer:": "The Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) food safety management system is a systematic, preventative approach to identifying, evaluating, and controlling hazards in food production and preparation. It focuses on identifying and controlling potential hazards at specific points in the food production process, rather than just testing finished products.\n\n7 Principles of HACCP:\n• Identify potential hazards that can occur at each step of the food production process, such as biological, chemical, and physical hazards.\n• Once hazards have been identified, the next step is to determine which points in the process are critical control points (CCPs) where hazards can be effectively controlled or prevented.\n• For each CCP, specific critical limits are established for factors such as temperature, time, and pH.\n• Monitoring procedures are implemented to ensure that the critical limits are being met at the CCPs.\n• If monitoring indicates that a CCP is not within the established critical limits, corrective actions are taken to bring it back into compliance. \n• Verification ensures that the HACCP system is working effectively and that the food being produced is safe to eat.\n• Effective record-keeping and documentation are important to ensuring that the system is functioning as it should and to provide a history of the food safety activities in the facility.\n\nHACCP is mandatory for most of the food production companies and food service organizations. It is often required by regulatory bodies and industry organizations to ensure food safety and it is also a requirement in international trade."

  "Determine on-floor assortments": {
    "Answer:": "An assortment strategy in retailing involves the number and type of products that stores display for purchase by consumers. Also \ncalled a \"product assortment strategy,\" it is a strategic tool that retailers use to manage and increase sales. The strategy is \ncomprised of two major components:\n1. The depth of products offered, or how many variations of a particular product a store carries\n2. The width of the product variety, or how many different types of products a store carries\nA deep assortment of products means that a retailer carries a number of variations of a single product. A wide variety—the \nopposite of a narrow variety—of products means that a retailer carries a large number of different products.\n\nHow Assortment Strategies Work \nEssentially, a product assortment strategy is a retail industry sales tool with the concepts \nof depth and breadth at its core. However, not all retailers will be able to use both components of this strategy at the same time. \nAn assortment strategy can have many layers of sub and related strategies, as each store will need to tailor the strategy to address \nits own particular needs and goals.\n\nAn assortment strategy is not one-size-fits-all; it needs to be customized to respond to a business's parameters.\n\nA Challenge for Small Stores \nRetailers face a trade-off when determining an assortment strategy. Choosing both a wide \nvariety  and a deep assortment of products simultaneously requires a large amount of space, and is typically reserved for big \nbox retailers.\n\nStores with smaller spaces may choose to specialize in a certain type of product and offer customers a variety of colors and \nstyles; other stores may offer a deep assortment of products but a narrow variety\n\nAdjusting for Demographics \nBy grouping together items that they believe would appeal to certain types of customers, retailers \nmay fine-tune their assortment strategies to target consumers' demographic profiles. If a retailer wants to attract customers who \nare new parents, for example, it might fill the shelves with infant apparel from trendy brands, along with toys, bedding and so \non.\n\nA Strategic Selling Tool  \nA strategically arranged product assortment can upsell customers on supplemental items as they \nsearch for the thing that brought them to the store. Grouping related items together strategically, whether or not they are \nnecessities, is a common way to stimulate impulse buying.\n\nPotential Disadvantages of Assortment Strategies \nAlthough the depth of product assortment may help attract customers, there are certain caveats to relying only on an assortment strategy. If items in an assortment are placed incorrectly, the demand for \nthese products may vary drastically. For example, if less-popular items are mixed in with popular items, they could detract from \nthe more-popular items' appeal. Or if the assortment is too vast, then customers may have difficulty finding the item they are \nlooking for. Overwhelming shoppers with too many buying options can be counterproductive and discourage customers' \nengagement."

  "Determine relationships among total revenue, marginal revenue, output, and profit ": {
    "Answer:": "Total revenue, marginal revenue, output, and profit are all interrelated concepts in economics and business. Here is how they relate to each other:\n\nTotal revenue: Total revenue is the total amount of money a business receives from the sale of its goods or services. It is calculated by multiplying the price of the goods or services by the quantity sold.\n\nMarginal revenue: Marginal revenue is the additional revenue a business receives from selling one additional unit of a good or service. It is calculated by dividing the change in total revenue by the change in quantity sold.\n\nOutput: Output refers to the quantity of goods or services produced by a business. It is directly related to total revenue and marginal revenue, as an increase in output will lead to an increase in total revenue and marginal revenue.\n\nProfit: Profit is the difference between a business's total revenue and its total costs. It is calculated by subtracting total costs from total revenue.\n\n\nIn general, as output increases, total revenue will also increase, and the marginal revenue will decrease, as the business reaches the point of diminishing returns. The relationship between output and profit is not a direct one, as profit also depends on the cost of production. If the cost of production increases, the profit will decrease even if the output increases."

  "Determine the cost/value of inventory": {
    "Answer:": "There are several methods for determining the cost of inventory, including:\nFirst-in, first-out (FIFO): Under the FIFO method, the cost of inventory is based on the assumption that goods are sold in the order in which they were acquired. The cost of goods sold is based on the cost of the oldest goods in inventory, while the cost of ending inventory is based on the cost of the most recent goods acquired.\n\nLast-in, first-out (LIFO): Under the LIFO method, the cost of inventory is based on the assumption that goods are sold in the reverse order in which they were acquired. The cost of goods sold is based on the cost of the most recent goods in inventory, while the cost of ending inventory is based on the cost of the oldest goods acquired.\n\nWeighted average cost: This method calculates an average cost for all the inventory by dividing the total cost of goods available by the total units available. This method will give an average cost per unit but it doesn't keep track of specific purchase costs.\n\nSpecific identification: This method assigns the cost of each item to the specific item sold. This method is accurate but it can be administratively cumbersome and is generally only used for inventory items which are highly individualized like one-of-a-kind items."

  "Discuss the nature of margin accounts": {
    "Answer:": "A margin account is a type of brokerage account that allows investors to borrow money from their broker to buy securities. The securities serve as collateral for the loan. When an investor buys securities on margin, they are required to maintain a minimum balance, known as the maintenance margin, in their account. If the value of the securities in the account falls below the maintenance margin, the investor will receive a margin call, which requires them to either add more money to the account or sell some of the securities to bring the account balance up to the required level.\n\nMargin accounts can be a useful tool for investors who want to leverage their capital in order to increase their potential returns. However, they also carry additional risks, as the investor is borrowing money and is responsible for paying interest on the loan. If the value of the securities in the account declines significantly, the investor may be required to sell their securities at a loss to meet the margin call, which could result in significant financial losses. As a result, margin accounts are generally not suitable for all investors, and it is important to carefully consider the risks before opening a margin account."

  "Discuss the nature of market timing": {
    "Answer:": "Market timing is the attempt to predict future market movements and to buy or sell securities based on those predictions. It is a strategy that is often employed by investors who believe that they can anticipate changes in the market and take advantage of them by buying or selling at the right time.\n\nThere are many different approaches to market timing, ranging from technical analysis, which involves analyzing past price and volume data to identify patterns that may indicate future price movements, to fundamental analysis, which involves analyzing a company's financial and economic data to evaluate its prospects.\n\nWhile some investors believe that market timing can be a successful strategy, it is generally considered to be difficult, if not impossible, to consistently predict market movements. Markets are influenced by a wide range of factors, including economic conditions, government policies, and investor sentiment, which can be difficult to predict with any degree of accuracy. In addition, attempting to time the market often involves significant transaction costs, such as brokerage fees, which can eat into returns.\n\nAs a result, many financial experts recommend a long-term, buy-and-hold investment strategy rather than attempting to time the market. This involves building a diversified portfolio of securities and holding onto them for an extended period of time, rather than trying to predict short-term market movements."

It is administered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and is funded by both the federal government and the states.\n\nEligibility for Medicaid is based on income, with the program generally available to those with household incomes at or below 138% of the federal poverty level. However, each state has the option to set its own eligibility guidelines and may choose to cover additional groups, such as low-income adults without children or those with higher incomes.\n\nMedicaid covers a wide range of health care services, including preventive care, primary care, specialty care, hospital stays, and prescription drugs. It also covers certain long-term care services, such as nursing home care and home health care, for those who are eligible.\n\nIn addition to providing health insurance coverage to low-income individuals and families, Medicaid also plays a critical role in funding the health care system, with a large portion of its funds going towards paying for the care of seniors and people with disabilities. It is a vital source of coverage for many Americans and plays a key role in ensuring access to affordable health care."

  "Discuss the nature of mining unstructured data": {
    "Answer:": "Mining unstructured data refers to the process of extracting valuable information and insights from data that does not have a pre-defined data model or structure, such as text, images, audio, or video. This is in contrast to structured data, which is organized into clearly defined fields, such as those found in a relational database. Unstructured data mining typically involves a variety of techniques from natural language processing, computer vision, and machine learning. Depending on the type and source of the data, different techniques may be used to extract useful information.\n\nFor example, if the unstructured data is in the form of text, natural language processing (NLP) techniques such as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and text summarization may be used to extract meaningful information. Sentiment analysis can determine whether the text expresses a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment, while named entity recognition can identify and extract specific entities such as people, organizations, and locations. Text summarization can create a condensed version of the text that retains the most important information.\n\nIf the unstructured data is in the form of images or videos, computer vision techniques such as object detection, image segmentation, and facial recognition may be used to extract meaningful information. Object detection can identify and locate objects within an image, while image segmentation can divide the image into multiple segments and identify the objects in each segment. Facial recognition can identify the faces present in an image and compare them against a database of known faces to determine the identity of the individuals in the image.\n\nMachine Learning techniques are usually applied to all the above techniques to improve their performance and analyze complex patterns on the data. Mining unstructured data can be a challenging task due to the lack of structure, but it can also yield valuable insights that would be difficult or impossible to obtain from structured data alone."

  "Discuss the nature of operational risk management": {
    "Answer:": "Operational risk management (ORM) is the process of identifying, assessing, and mitigating the risks associated with an organization's operations. These risks can come from a wide variety of sources, including internal processes, systems, and people, as well as external factors such as natural disasters, cyber-attacks, and market fluctuations.\n\nThe goal of ORM is to minimize the potential negative impact of these risks on an organization's operations and reputation, while also ensuring compliance with relevant laws and regulations. ORM is therefore an integral part of an organization's overall risk management strategy, and is typically overseen by a dedicated team or individual within the organization.\n\nThere are several key elements involved in ORM, including identification, assessment, mitigation, monitoring and review, & communication and reporting. ORM is a continuous process that requires regular reviews, monitoring, and updating as the environment and the organization changes over time. The processes and controls put in place should be flexible enough to adapt to the changing environment and they must be also tested regularly to ensure they remain effective."

  "Discuss the nature of pro forma statements": {
    "Answer:": "Pro forma statements are financial statements that are used to project a company's future financial performance. They are often used to provide a snapshot of a company's financial situation, and are typically used to help companies plan for future growth and development. The term \"pro forma\" comes from the Latin phrase \"pro forma,\" which means \"as a matter of form\" or \"for the sake of form.\"\n\nPro forma statements are often used in financial forecasting and budgeting, and can include projections for things like revenue, expenses, profits, and cash flow. They can also be used to assess the financial impact of potential business decisions, such as mergers and acquisitions, or to evaluate the performance of a company's management team. Pro forma statements are typically created using historical financial data, as well as information about future market conditions and trends. Companies often use a variety of financial and economic models to create pro forma statements, including discounted cash flow (DCF) models and Monte Carlo simulations.\n\nPro forma statements are not audited financial statements, and therefore may not necessarily be accurate or reliable. They may also not fully capture all aspects of a company’s financial situation. For example, many pro forma statements do not include non-recurring or one-time charges that could have an impact on the financial performance, such as legal settlements, write-downs, or restructuring charges. Due to this reason, it is important for users of pro forma statements to be aware of the limitations of these statements and to not rely solely on the figures presented in them."

  "Discuss the nature of problem loan management": {
    "Answer:": "Problem loan management is the process of identifying, monitoring, and addressing loans that are at risk of default. This is a critical function for financial institutions, as problem loans can have a significant impact on a bank's financial stability and profitability.\n\nThe first step in problem loan management is identifying loans that are at risk of default. This is typically done by analyzing a variety of financial metrics, such as loan-to-value ratios, debt service coverage ratios, and delinquency rates. Once loans have been identified as problematic, they are typically placed in a special category known as a \"watchlist\" or \"classified assets\". Banks then closely monitor these loans, typically through regular reporting and site visits, in order to assess the borrower's ability to repay the loan and to identify any early warning signs of default.\n\nBanks use various methods to manage problem loans, such as loan modification, debt restructuring, and foreclosure, with the goal of minimizing losses and preserving the value of the loan. If a borrower is unable to repay a loan, the bank may attempt to sell the loan to another party, or they may take possession of the underlying collateral and liquidate it. Problem loan management is an ongoing process that requires close collaboration between the bank's credit, risk management, and collections departments. It's important for banks to have a well-established process in place for managing problem loans and to have a dedicated team in place to manage the process, so they can mitigate the risk of losses and maintain the bank's financial stability."

The design stage is when the product is engineered and developed, then through the prototyping, testing and validation stages, the product is refined and improved. Finally, during the commercialization stage, the product is manufactured, marketed and launched to the target market.\n\nProduct development is a critical part of business success and it is essential for companies to have a well-defined product development process in place, so they can create and launch successful products in a timely and efficient manner. It is an ongoing process, as after the launch, the product still needs to be monitored, evaluated and improved upon when needed, to continue to meet the needs of the market."

    "Answer:": "Purchasing methods refer to the various ways that organizations acquire the goods and services they need to operate and produce goods or services. These methods can include purchasing from a supplier through a purchase order, using a request for proposal (RFP) process, using a sealed bid process, or through strategic sourcing.\n\nIn a purchase order process, a company will select a supplier and place an order for the goods or services that they need. In an RFP process, companies will solicit proposals from multiple suppliers, and will then select the one that best meets their needs. In a sealed bid process, companies will invite suppliers to submit sealed bids for a specific project, and will then award the contract to the supplier that submitted the lowest bid. Strategic sourcing is a longer-term approach to purchasing that involves analyzing the entire supply chain and working closely with suppliers to reduce costs, improve quality, and increase efficiency.\n\nDifferent organizations will choose different purchasing methods depending on the type of goods or services they need, the size of the purchase, and the strategic objectives of the organization.

  "Discuss the nature of stock adjustments": {
    "Answer:": "Stock adjustments refer to changes made to the level of inventory held by a business. These adjustments can include both increases and decreases in inventory levels, and can be made for a variety of reasons. One common reason for making a stock adjustment is to account for changes in demand for a particular product. For example, if a business experiences an unexpected spike in demand for a product, they may need to increase their inventory levels to ensure they have enough stock on hand to meet customer demand. Similarly, if demand for a product decreases, the business may need to decrease their inventory levels to avoid excess stock.\n\nAnother reason for making stock adjustments is to account for damages or losses. For example, if a product is damaged or stolen, the business will need to adjust their inventory levels to reflect the loss. Similarly, if a product becomes obsolete or is no longer in demand, the business may need to write off the inventory and make a stock adjustment to reflect the decrease in value. Stock adjustments are also made to account for changes in the cost of goods. For instance, if the cost of raw materials used to produce a product increases, the business will need to adjust their inventory levels to reflect the higher cost of goods. Regular inventory count is done to verify and compare with the current books' record, this allows the businesses to identify discrepancies and make necessary adjustments accordingly.\n\nAll in all, the nature of stock adjustments is to ensure that a business has an accurate record of its inventory levels, and that it maintains an appropriate level of stock to meet customer demand while avoiding excess stock that can lead to financial losses."

  "Discuss the nature of stock options": {
    "Answer:": "Stock options are a type of compensation that give employees the right to purchase a certain number of shares of a company's stock at a fixed price, known as the exercise price or strike price. These options typically vest over a period of time, meaning that the employee must work for the company for a certain period of time before they are able to exercise their options. Once the options are vested, the employee can purchase the stock at the exercise price and then sell it on the open market for the current market price. The difference between the market price and the exercise price is known as the gain on the option.\n\nStock options are typically offered as an incentive to attract and retain talented employees. They align the interests of the employees with those of the company's shareholders as the employees' wealth is tied to the company's performance. They give employees a stake in the company and a sense of ownership, which can motivate them to work harder to improve the company's performance. Additionally, offering stock options can be beneficial for a company because it allows them to attract talented employees without having to pay them in cash, which can be especially beneficial for startup companies with limited resources.\n\nHowever, stock options also have their drawbacks. One of the main criticisms is that they can create incentives for executives to manipulate the financial performance of the company in order to inflate the stock price and realize gains on their options. Additionally, if a company's stock price falls, employees who have exercised their options may end up holding stock that is worth less than they paid for it, which can be detrimental to employee morale and retention."

  "Discuss the nature of the secondary mortgage market": {
    "Answer:": "The secondary mortgage market refers to the market where mortgages, or loans used to purchase real estate, are bought and sold by financial institutions and investors. This market is secondary to the primary market, where mortgages are originated by lenders such as banks and credit unions, and then sold to borrowers.\n\nIn the secondary market, financial institutions and investors purchase mortgages from the primary market in order to hold them as investments or to package them into securities, such as mortgage-backed securities (MBS). These securities are sold to investors, such as pension funds and insurance companies, who can then earn income from the interest and principal payments made by borrowers.\n\nThe secondary market plays a key role in providing liquidity to the primary mortgage market, by allowing mortgage originators to sell their mortgages, they can then use the proceeds to make new loans, facilitating further lending and providing access to credit to borrowers. Another key function of the secondary market is to transfer risk from the lenders who originated the mortgages to investors who purchase the securities. Because securities are purchased by multiple investors, the risk of defaults is spread out among them, reducing the impact of any individual default on a lender.\n\nSome of the main players in the secondary mortgage market include government-sponsored enterprises like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, who purchase mortgages from primary market lenders and then package them into securities for sale to investors. Additionally, there are private institutions and investment funds that purchase mortgages from primary market lenders and hold them as investments, or package them into securities for sale to investors."

  "Discuss the relationship between bond prices and yields": {
    "Answer:": "The relationship between bond prices and yields is inversely proportional. When bond prices go up, the yield goes down and vice versa. As the price of a bond increases, the yield decreases, which makes the bond more attractive to investors, as they will earn a lower return. Conversely, when bond prices decrease, the yield increases, making the bond less attractive to investors as they will earn a higher return. This relationship occurs because bond prices and yields are directly related to the interest rate at which the bond pays, if interest rates go down, bond prices go up and yields decrease and if interest rates go up bond prices go down and yields increase. Investors monitor this relationship to make decisions on their investments, as the bond prices, yields and interest rates change over time."

  "Document employee issues (e.g., reasonable suspicion, harassment, attendance) and recommend solutions.": {
    "Answer:": "Documentation is crucial for proper decision-making: In the world of human resources and employment, documentation about an employee’s performance can make or break your ability to discipline, terminate, or fairly promote, reward, and recognize employees. Documentation is essential for managers and HR staff because you need to make a serious effort to record all of the events in the employment history of your employees—both positive and negative incidents of performance. Here you will find everything that managers and HR staff need to carefully document employee performance.\n\nWhy you should document employee performance: \n1. Documentation provides evidence that performance issues were discussed with the employee in a timely and concise fashion. Documentation offers a history of the employee’s improvement or failure to improve performance over time. It is chronological and a precise description of the employee’s actions, the manager’s actions, and events as they occur.\n2. Documentation provides evidence that supports management decisions to take unfavorable action such as discipline or termination with an employee.\n3. Documentation offers proof that an employee deserves an available promotion or opportunity over other employees who are also eligible.\n4. Documentation provides evidence to justify salary increases, decreases, or why an employee received no raise.\n5. In the event of a lawsuit, complete and thorough documentation protects an employer's interests. The documentation can support management's actions in terminating an unsuccessful employee. It also can prove that the employee was terminated for reasons that are legal as opposed to others such as illegal discrimination. \n\nWhat to document:\nManagers need to document employee performance, both positive contributions and performance failures. They need to document exactly what the employee did and said and what the manager did and said in response during the meeting or conversation. You need to document any agreements made during the conversation, goals set, improvements required and expected, and the timeline for improvement. Documentation should also contain commitments that the manager makes to assist the employee.\n\nHow to document:\n- Documentation should be written during or immediately following the meeting or conversation with the employee. You should never miss writing down the conversation with the employee on the day when it actually happened. Waiting until later or the next day affects the quality of the documentation because it is based on what you remember. \n- One of the worst mistakes managers make is to believe that they can reconstruct an employee counseling history as needed. No HR person who has any experience of decent, timely documentation is ever fooled by a reconstructed record. Managers who reconstruct from memory bring unnecessary and unacceptable risk to their company because a made-up history won't hold up in a potential lawsuit. \n- You need your documentation to appear professional, neat, and organized. Write documentation as if you are talking about the history of the happenings to a third party. You never know who may read your documentation one day, so make sure that it reflects your professionalism (back of a cocktail napkin, envelope, or sticky note doesn't qualify as professional documentation). \n- Your documentation should go to an employee’s new manager if the employee obtains a new job—or you do—in your organization. For your memory and to inform the employee’s new manager, you need to put the employee’s name and title, your name and title, and the full date on each document.\n- Write documentation that is factual, fair, legal, objective, complete, and consistent. Avoid opinions (Mike is sloppy. Alice is lazy. Tom was lying to me.), name-calling, editorializing (John is a jerk. Mark has an attitude problem.), and labeling (Mary is irresponsible. George is not a team player).\n- Avoid also trying to interpret the employee’s behavior. (Marsha must not like this assignment. Paula appears to be in over her head.) Minimize your use of descriptive words such as adjectives and adverbs (slowly, sloppily, unhappy, moody, rude). State the employee's specific behavior and actions, not your opinion or interpretation of it.\n\nWhat documentation must provide:\n- In the later review of the documentation, what is needed is an accurate record of the conversation. Stick with the facts and write down just what you said and what the employee said. Make sure that your documentation is unambiguous and that it gets the facts straight. In any potential legal situation, errors in any of the documented events make all of the rest of the documentation suspect.\n- Finally, document any agreements, commitments, timelines, improvements needed, check-in points, and other details that might slip from memory. Make certain that you set a date and time for deadlines and due dates so that misunderstanding won't occur.\n- Know your HR department's documentation policy, which will tell you what documentation needs placement in the employee's personnel file. Any documentation of disciplinary actions should certainly be included.\n\nWhere to document and store documentation:\n- Since documentation about employees is confidential and private to the employee, you need to take care that any documentation remains confidential to the manager, HR, and potentially the employee's next manager. Thus, putting documentation on a shared computer drive is not recommended. Handwritten documentation and a manager's documentation printed out are best kept in locked storage.\n\nThe bottom line:\n- If you follow these guidelines, when you go to HR to ask for help in disciplining, terminating, or transferring an employee to a job with a better potential fit, HR will help you solve the problem or improve the situation. When HR tells you to document, document, document or they can't help you; you'll have to have all of your bases covered."

  "Establish relationship with customer/client": {},
  "Establish relationship with hospitality and tourism customer/guest.": {
    "Answer:": "Building and maintaining strong guest relationships is essential to a modern hotel’s success, especially for independent hotels without access to constant technology upgrades and endless marketing budgets.\nA recent report from the American Customer Satisfaction Index Travel Report indicates that, while guests love hotel websites, there’s much less love for hotel loyalty programmes. At a time when such a strong book direct movement is taking shape, low satisfaction with loyalty programmes should ring some alarms.\n\nSo how can you make sure that your hotel, at least, has an all-star track record with building guest loyalty? Key themes are:\n· Building trust among first-time guests through your reviews and content\n· Developing your hotel’s USPs to keep those guests coming back\n· Using email to send them offers tailored to their interests and increase familiarity\n\n“The lack of differentiation among Internet travel companies means the real competition is with the websites of hotels and airlines,” says Claes Fornell, ACSI founder and Chairman. “Consumers like the convenience of one-stop shopping for their travel needs, but online booking sites reduce revenue for airlines and hotels by charging them commission. Airlines and hotels have tried to lessen the appeal of Internet travel sites by eliminating loyalty perks for those who book through a third party and by providing a better online experience on their own sites.”\n\nMany hoteliers collect and analyze data, but not everyone knows how to use their insights to set goals and objectives for their team. When it comes to your online reputation, knowing what to look at is the first step in making sure you’re putting your best foot forward online. Check out these KPIs to set realistic goals, involve all members of your team, and obtain a deeper understanding of how you’re performing in the eyes of your guests.\n\nContent marketing is more than a buzzword. It’s an important part of your hotel’s marketing strategy. Simply put, it’s the creation and distribution of valuable assets, such as videos, blog posts, and e-newsletters, as marketing tools to attract and retain customers. For hotels and other accommodation providers, these assets showcase your property’s unique story and brand. They attract your target guests, influence them to book a stay, and retain them as repeat guests.\n\nCreating emails that get responses is an incredibly valuable skill for marketers. Responses in the hotel email marketing world typically equate to directly attributable revenue – direct bookings, upgrades, amenity purchases, and more.\nThey can also drive engagement and develop a rapport with guests who have booked with you in the past, and make them more likely to book again in the future. But, what makes an email likely to get a response?\n\nA good book direct strategy is near the top of most hotelier’s list this year. Book direct campaigns from Marriott and Hilton are making headlines, and the focus of the industry as a whole is pivoting to look at booking direct as the way to grow profit margins. Competition in the hospitality industry is at an all-time high, and it is only going to get fiercer. If hotels want to outdo sharing sites like Airbnb and, more importantly (at least for now), their competitor sets, they need to be doing everything they can to optimise their online presence and drive direct bookings."

  "Explain how debit cards differ from credit cards": {
    "Answer:": "Credit cards assign you a credit limit, an amount that you can spend on the card at any time. By definition, this is credit…not cash you actually have. When you pay with a credit card, the bank pays the merchant immediately, but you don't have to pay the bank until the end of the month or over the course of many months (in which case the card charges you interest). \n\nDebit cards work like instant checks. When you pay with a debit card, the payment network immediately deducts the purchase amount from your bank account. If you don't have the money for the purchase in the bank, you can't spend it using a debit card.(Unless you have overdraft “protection”, in which case the bank will let the transaction go through but charge you a fee for overdrawing the account)."

For example, it is important to plan for the number of employee’s a business can support and a business needs in order to not be in a situation where there are not enough employees or there are too many employees that the business can no longer pay all the salaries. Strategic planning involves setting a direction, setting goals, creating strategies, planning action, and monitoring/evaluating progress. Human resources management is involved in the strategic planning process because based on the goals and the direction set by the business, the number of employees must be planned based on what the company wants to achieve. Monitoring and evaluating progress is also involved in the form of reflecting on if more or less employees are needed based on observations."

  "Explain how interest rate, compounding frequency and loan length affect the cost of using credit ": {
    "Answer:": "Compound interest is interest calculated on the initial principal and also on the accumulated interest of previous periods of deposit or loan. Compound interest can be thought of as “interest on interest,” and will make a deposit or loan grow at a faster rate than simple interest, which is interest calculated only on the principal amount. The rate at which compound interest accrues depends on the frequency of compounding; the higher the number of compounding periods, the greater the compound interest. Thus, the amount of compound interest accrued on $100 compounded at 10% annually will be lower than that on $100 compounded at 5% semi-annually over the same time period. The length of the loan also impacts the cost of using credit. The longer the length of the loan, the smaller the monthly payments, but the total interest charge will increase because it will be compounded over a longer period of time."

  "Explain key ratios/terms in banking": {
    "Answer:": "Net Interest Margin = (Interest Income – Interest Expense) / Total Assets. Net Interest Margin measures the difference between the income generated by interest, and the expenses due to interest. This is important since a bank’s main source of income and largest expense is created by interest. Net Interest Margin is important to consider because it shows how much a bank is earning in on investments, compared to how much interest it is paying out to its depositors (people who leave money in the bank).\n\nEfficiency Ratio = Non-Interest Expense / Revenue. The efficiency ratio measures a bank’s operating efficiency. Non-interest expenses are used because those are controllable by the bank (ie. marketing, operational expenses, etc.). A lower efficiency ratio is better because it means the bank can turn the same amount of resources into more revenue. \n\nOperating Leverage = Growth Rate of Revenue – Growth Rate of Non-Interest Expense. Operating leverage is another measure of operating efficiency comparing the growth of revenue with the growth of non-interest expenses. A positive ratio shows revenue is growing faster than the expenses, which is beneficial for the bank. A negative ratio shows that there are operating inefficiencies in the bank.\n\nLiquidity Coverage Ratio = High-Quality Liquid Asset Amount / Total Net Cash Flow Amount . The liquidity coverage ratio measures the ability of a bank to meet short-term (usually within 30 days) loans and payments without having to access any outside cash.\n\nLeverage Ratio = Tier 1 Capital / Total Assets. Tier 1 Capital is the bank's equity capital and disclosed reserves. The leverage ratio measures the ability of a bank to cover its exposures with tier 1 capital.\n\nCET1 Ratio = Common Equity Tier 1 Capital / Risk-Weighted Assets. This one is similar to the leverage ratio, but weightings are assigned to assets based on their risk, and the common equity tier 1 capital is used instead of tier 1 capital. Common Equity Tier 1 Capital is a component of Tier 1 Capital that is for the most part common stock held by a financial institution.\n\nProvision for Credit Losses (PCL) Ratio = Provision for Credit Losses / Net Loans and Acceptances. The provision for credit losses (PCL) is a provision amount that a bank sets aside to cover the loans they assess to have a high probability of being not collectible. The PCL ratio assesses the riskiness of loans written by the bank when compared to other investors."

The following issues are not the only ones you will see and you will likely deal with others.

Disputes between employees or a disagreement between an employee and business owner are situations that can occur frequently. One of the biggest issues is how two parties talk to each other, or whether they talk at all.

This means that your HR has to spend time going over timesheet attendance records to check details.\nAdequate Safety in the Workplace\n- Promoting safety in the workplace should be a top priority of every business owner. This should be true no matter what industry they are in. This includes making sure all proper safety equipment is used and that the right security measures are put in place. \nAnnual Leave Disputes \n- Ensure that your employees know what the company’s leave policy is. \nTimekeeping and Attendance Issues \n- Timekeeping and attendance issues are common.\n- Having an effective employee relations plan in place will help you in numerous ways.

  "Explain legal and ethical considerations in selling": {
    "Answer:": "These responsibilities are particularly important in personal selling because salespeople may face conflicts between their personal standards and the standards of their firms and customers. However, the evolution of selling has raised ethical standards and expectations; building long-term relationships with customers doesn't allow for unethical behavior. Salespeople's ethical standards determine how they conduct relationships with their customers, employers, and competitors. Ethical issues in relations with customers involve the use of entertainment and gifts and the disclosure of confidential information. Ethical issues in relations with employers involve expenses and job changes. Finally, salespeople must be careful in how they talk about competitors and treat competitive products. Many companies have ethical standards that describe the behavior expected of their salespeople. In evaluating potential employers, salespeople should consider these standards. Salespeople also encounter many situations not covered by company statements and therefore must develop personal standards of right and wrong. Without personal standards, salespeople will lose their self-respect and the respect of their company and customers. Good ethics are good business. Over the long run, salespeople with a strong sense of ethics will be more successful than salespeople who compromise their own and society's ethics for short-term gain. Statutory laws (such as the Uniform Commercial Code) and administrative laws (such as Federal Trade Commission rulings)guide the activities of salespeople in the United States. Selling in international markets is complex because of cultural differences in ethical judgments and laws that relate to sales activities in various countries."

  "Explain legal responsibilities associated with financial exchanges": {
    "Answer:": "• Customers are responsible for all transactions they enter into – including online transactions where they provide credit card or other financial data \n• Bank responsible for fraudulent credit card transactions if credit card agreement offers \n• Bank responsible for transactions which occur after a debit or credit card has been reported lost or stolen \n• Banks responsible for transactions which occur if a device is placed on a debit or credit card machine which copies customer data \n• Banks responsible for transactions which occur if bank system is hacked into \n• Sales are legal contracts where goods are transferred from the seller to the buyer for a price. Payment occurs when the buyer delivers the agreed price and the seller accepts it. The receipt of goods is when the buyer takes physical possession of thegoods. When an item is sold and the buyer pays, or promises to pay using credit, it becomes a legal transaction and the buyer is legally contracted to pay the agreed amount within the agreed time frame. Extending credit usually involves filling out paperwork and receiving approval to ensure that the (potential) buyer will be able to pay the indicated amount within the time given."

    "Answer:": "A total rewards program is a program implemented by a business to motivate employees with a complete package of incentives, benefits, and rewards. Its effectiveness can be analyzed by looking at some key metrics within the business, including employee motivation and efficiency. Surveys can also be given out to examine the degree of motivation that these total rewards programs bring to employees. To analyze the motivation brought to employees, one can use motivation theories such as Herzberg’s Dual Factor Theory, Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs, or the Daniel Pink Motivation Theory to further analyze the effectiveness of these total rewards programs on employee motivation, and find if there are any aspects that the business could improve upon."

  "Explain methods used to analyze capital investments (e.g., payback period, discounted breakeven, net present value,accounting rate of return, internal rate of return, etc.)": {
    "Answer:": "There are many methods that can be used to analyze capital investments. For example, the payback period is an estimate of how long it will take to pay back a loan/investment based on cash flow. The discounted breakeven is an analysis to determine when an investment will break even, discounting future cash flows and taking the time value of money into account (for example, inflation). Breaking even means that enough money was earned from the investment in order to cover the costs of acquiring and owning it. Net present value is a formula that finds if a long term project or investment will be profitable in the future. Accounting rate of return is a formula (Average annual profit ÷ Initial investment) to determine what percent of your initial investment you are predicted to earn each year as an average. Internal rate of return is the annual rate of growth that an investment is expected to make, using a similar formula to that for net present value with the net present value set to 0."

  "Explain methods used to value inventory (e.g., FIFO, LIFO, average cost, etc.) ": {
    "Answer:": "Using point-of-sale terminals that keep track of inventory as it is received and sold (perpetual method), there are 3 flow assumptions to value inventory: LIFO, FIFO, weighted/moving Average. \n• LIFO – Last-in-first-out – The assumption is that the newest goods arriving in the store are the first ones sold, and that the older merchandise is left. Generally, prices increase over time. LIFO results in higher COGS (cost of goods sold) andlower ending inventory. Higher COGS results in lower net income. Lower ending inventory results in lower current and total assets, and a Balance Sheet inventory value that, over time, becomes further and further from its replacement value. Ex: COGS = $10,245; Inventory = $1,520 \n• FIFO – First-in-first-out – The assumption is that the oldest goods in the store are the first ones sold, and that the newest merchandise is left. FIFO results in lower COGS, higher net income, higher inventory value, and higher current and total assets. Ex: COGS = $10,025; Inventory = $1,740 \n• Weighted average – The assumption is that an average of old and new merchandise is sold. Every time merchandise is purchased, a new average cost per item is calculated. Every time merchandise is sold, it is removed from inventory at the average price. This results in COGS and inventory values that fall between LIFO and FIFO."

Since counterfeit money would be an incurred loss if accepted, it is important to detect counterfeit bills before accepting them. If a bill is suspicious, one can refuse the note and explain the suspicion. Every business has its own policies for reporting counterfeit money, but generally it may look like reporting it to a manager in order to determine next steps."

  "Explain promotional methods used by the hospitality and tourism industry": {
    "Answer:": "The tourism industry is unlike any other because, instead of a product, you are selling a place and all the things it has to offer.You are competing with the entire world every time you promote tourism in a given destination, and this high level of competition demands a creative and unique approach. To be successful, your marketing should constantly put forth the best possible image of your destination, while creating interest on a broad scale in as many ways as possible. \n\nPartnerships help maximize your marketing dollars and reach a broader and more desirable audience when promoting tourism for a given destination. Instead of attempting to create a broad base of followers and a reach that extends throughout the world, piggyback with a partner who already has that reach in a way that benefits both parties. For example, enter into a marketing contract with a national travel agency. Grant the agency special deals and promotions for its customers in exchange for nationwide access to the customer base. You will have to pay for the privilege, of course, but the return can far outweigh the expense, and the alternative of building your own national network is often unrealistic. \n\nTrade Shows provide your destination with access to every travel and tourism supplier in the region and beyond, every travelseller and company who sells or wants to sell your destination and the general public who has an interest in what you're offering.Whether you attend existing trade shows around the country and the world, or you organize your own to bring attention and forward motion to your destination, the results can be beneficial. Trade shows bring together every aspect of the travel industry in one place and allow time for meetings, interaction and new deals. They also draw media attention, public attendees and, if they are large enough, national travel agencies and their millions of customers. \n\nAdvertising --Take out ads in trade publications to get the eyes of travel sellers around the country onto your product. Create a brand for your destination that speaks to what you have to offer and why. For example, Las Vegas helped build its secretive escapist image by creating the \"What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas\" campaign. Find your destination's identity and describe it to the public so they understand why they want to visit you. Placing your ads in a smart and targeted manner is the final piece of the puzzle. For example, if you are in charge of tourism promotion for an outdoor adventure destination, you should be advertising in \"Field & Stream\" magazine instead of \"GQ.\" Making the most of your ad dollars is an important part of getting the job done. \n\nSponsorships --Sponsored events and giveaways that tie in with your destination and create a level of prestige for the brand.Sponsorships are available in all shapes and sizes from local parades to national events, each with its own target audiences and each with a specific set of benefits. Investigate events that take place in the regions you wish to reach that have a direct relationship with your tourism destination. For example, if you are promoting a great new art scene, look into local open-air art shows or national art conventions as possible sponsorships. Televised events have the extra benefit of local and sometimes national media coverage, a factor that multiplies your potential advertising reach significantly. It also tends to increase the cost of the sponsorship. \n\nFood Marketing --The fast food industry is highly competitive and dominated by large companies. Smaller businesses must be savvy in developing marketing strategies that drive consumer traffic. This entails staying in constant touch with customers. One of the best ways for smaller fast food companies to stay in touch with their companies is through marketing research. A small fast food company must know what key customers want and will buy before developing marketing and advertising strategies. \n\nCollectibles --Fast food companies can drive traffic through collectibles, particularly those that kids enjoy. Select a movie or popular animated film. Find companies who sell dolls, glasses or other mementos that are related to the movie. Offer four or six characters or glasses. Provide one free item for the purchase of a kids' meal. This fast food marketing strategy entices people to come back until they have all the collectibles. Choose a popular theme for your collectibles that other fast food companies are not marketing. \n\nMarket Segmentation --Small fast food companies often use market segmentation as a marketing tool. Market segmentation is the process of identifying key buying groups that patronize your restaurant. This information is largely obtained through market research surveys, asking people demographic information such as age, income and household size. For example, the majority of your customers may be 18 to 24 years old and earn less than $40,000 per year. You could then locate clusters of this demographic group within a 5-mile radius of your restaurant. Obtain the addresses of these residents and mail coupons to them. You can also segment your market by various activities, attitudes and customer usage.\n\nLoyalty Programs --Frequency card programs are a popular type of loyalty program for fast food restaurants. Create a display and sign-up forms to promote your frequency card program. Invite people to fill out an application. Reward people according to the frequency in which they visit your restaurant. For example, you could offer people a free drink after their first four visits,then free fries after their next four visits. Ultimately, a customer could earn a free meal after 12 visits. Keep repeating this cycle for six, eight or 10 weeks, or whichever time frame you choose. \n\nSocietal Marketing --Societal marketing includes volunteering or collecting money or items for charity. Societal or social marketing is designed more for getting ideas across than making sales. Consequently, consumers who relate to your ideas or values because of your charitable work may, in turn, patronize your fast food restaurant."

  "Explain reasons for ethical dilemmas": {
    "Answer:": "The nature of ethical dilemmas is that the ‘‘right thing to do’’ is not immediately or even eventually clear. These dilemmas are problems because their resolution is neither simple nor easy and they must be confronted under time pressures as well as conflicting financial and political demands. Often the ‘‘right answer’’ comes with a price tag. Moreover, in many instances, the crucial factors underlying the dilemma are not immediately obvious. So, how can individuals better resolve these dilemmas and reduce their chance of making a mistake that they will later regret? As in many areas of life, we often fail in ethics, not because we don’t know the right answer, but rather fail to ask the right questions. To tackle ethical dilemmas and avoid making ethical mistakes, executives, managers, and professionals can use the following five questions, which, while they will not guarantee making the right decision, can help prevent making the wrong one. They are: \n• What are my self-interests in this situation and how might they influence me? Self-interests are a natural part of human nature. They are neither necessarily good nor bad but should be acknowledged so as to prevent you from doing something unethical. \n• What are the interests of others and the larger society and to what extent should I take them into consideration? What would lead to the greatest good for the greatest number and to what extent should that be my predominant criterion in this situation?\n• What principles and values, laws and regulations, policies and procedures, or socially appropriate behaviors do I need to consider? Are the relevant principles or processes more important than outcomes? Am I willing to apply those same principles to myself regardless of the personal consequences? \n• In my job or role, my personal or professional relationships, or as a member of the larger society, what are my obligations to others? How should the principle of reciprocity apply? Are my obligations sufficiently important that I would be willing to sacrifice my self-interest, a fundamental principle or the greater good? \n• What is in my long-term best interest and that of society in general, and how can I simultaneously meet both those commitments? Where do my long-term interests and those of others intersect, and is there a decision or action that might satisfy both? \n• The challenge, having asked these five questions and considered their implications, is to understand and minimize any inherent conflicts among the values and obligations that they underscore. This can be addressed by focusing on three criteria for resolving such value conflicts: primacy, balance and acceptance. Primacy asks, ‘‘Which questions are most relevant to the values that are important to you and your organization in this situation?’’ Balance encourages seeking the best tradeoff if you must compromise among values. Acceptance asks, ‘‘How well will your decision and its underlying rationale likely hold up under public scrutiny?’’"

Also, one can use the one-percent rule, which states that one should not put more than one percent of the total capital in a single trade. Finally, some investors use the stop-less strategy, which essentially is the strategy to sell off a stock when the price falls below a certain level because a stock needs to rise more than it fell in order to break even. For example, a stock falling 20% needs to rise back 25% in order to break even."

    "Answer:": "The process of handling stock for deliveries is usually simple. The restaurant will prepare an order of items it wants from a supplier. The supplier will send the shipment on a truck along with either an itemized delivery slip or an invoice for whatever is being delivered. When the items are being moved from the truck to where they are being stored, someone from the store should be verifying the proper quantity and quality of items is being received. Once this is done, the paperwork for the delivery should be signed by both driver and receiver, and each will keep a copy for their records. The store owner, manager, or accountant, whoever is in charge of paying the bills, should compare all records to ensure they balance. It is important to realize that dishonest people do exist, and in our case, it could be a driver, one of our employees, a manager, or even our bookkeeper. The owner should always be prepared to watch his own business and money and eliminate situations where temptation might be acted on."

  "Explain storing considerations.": {
    "Answer:": "Imagine the mess you would have if you didn't manage your inventory. What inventory do you have to sell? How much did it cost you? Where is it? If done correctly, inventory management will keep many other aspects of your business in line. It gives you the clarity to notice so many issues before they have the chance to spiral out of control. It will help you solve challenges like the following: \n● Spending Too Much on Inventory and Storage Space: Managing the money you spend on your inventory and storage space of course saves you money. Many times the cost of storage is dependent on the amount of inventory you need to store. To optimize your inventory storage, use a blueprint of your store’s layout. This tool makes sure you use your space with a profitable mindset. \n● Loss Prevention (Retail Shrinkage): Stealing accounts for the biggest form of loss for retail stores.. Unorganized space makes it easier for customers, and even staff, to steal right from under your nose without you even noticing. Even if it doesn't come naturally to you, keeping your inventory organized is one of the first things you can do to prevent loss and retail shrinking. Plus, organizing your space helps you know where everything is. You can't manage stock if you can't find it.\n● Administrative Errors: Administrative errors, like miscounting stock, are a major cause of lost inventory and theft in retail stores. \n● Avoiding Dead Stock: When running a retail business you know how quickly things can go in and out of fashion. Deadstock is excess inventory that isn't selling or has been difficult to sell for long periods. Sometimes trends and fads go by quickly and it can be difficult to keep up without your inventory taking a hit. You can use a blueprint to determine the best place to put a sales rack, for example, and keep best-selling items at the front of your store. \n● Avoiding Being Out of Stock: The complete opposite can also be true of a retail store when inventory is mismanaged. If something is selling really well you need to make sure it’s always on hand, or risk losing sales. \n● Managing Your Supply Chain: Your supply chain is the process of making and receiving inventory for your store. Many different things affect a supply chain. For example, if you sell gold jewelry and the price of gold just skyrocketed, that means you’re paying more to obtain that jewelry for your retail store. This will have a huge effect on how much you spend on your inventory. Counteract this by making sure you only do business with reliable vendors and stay on top of changes in your industry. \nThink about it, if you know how much inventory you should have at all times, you know how much you spent to get it, how much space and storage units you need to keep it organized, and where it needs to be at all times."

  "Explain the concept of identity theft in relation to social networking sites": {
    "Answer:": "Social media utilizes internet or cellular phone based applications and tools to share information among people and connect users to new people through people they may already know. These include popular social networking sites such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Instagram. The purpose of some networking sites may be purely social, while others may focus on establishing business connections. Although the features of social networking sites differ, they all allow users to provide personal information about themselves and offer some type of communication mechanism (forums, chat rooms, email, instant messenger) that enables users to connect with others. \n\nIdentity theft is a crime in which an imposter obtains key personal information to commit fraud. They may use key pieces of information such as social insurance number, credit card number, date of birth, driver’s license or other information for their own personal gain (e.g. obtain credit card and bank accounts, redirect mail, establish cellular phone service, rent vehicles, equipment, or accommodation or secure employment). Identity theft via social media can occur through a data breach, computer virus, phishing, or email scams. \n\nSecurity Threats posed by Social Media \nSocial media sites rely on connections and communication, so users are encouraged to provide a certain amount of personal information. When deciding how much information to post and reveal, users may not exercise the same amount of caution as they would when meeting someone in person because the Internet provides a sense of anonymity and the lack of physical interaction provides a false sense of security. Also, users sometimes tailor the information for their friends to read, forgetting that others may see it.\n\nWhen sharing information online users need to understand the potential risks and be wary of what they share and with whom. Identity thieves are drawn to social media sites because of the accessibility and amount of personal information that's available to the public. Using information gathered through social media sites about your location, hobbies, interests, and friends, an identity thief may be able to gather enough personal information to assume your identity or the identity of one of your contacts. Even just a few personal details may provide identity thieves with enough information to guess answers to security or password reminder questions for email, credit card, or bank accounts."

  "Explain the impact of the cost of capital on capital investments": {
    "Answer:": "The cost of capital is the minimum rate of return that a business must earn before generating value. Before a business can turn a profit, it must at least generate sufficient income to cover the cost of the capital it uses to fund its operations. This consists of both the cost of debt and the cost of equity used for financing a business. A company’s cost of capital depends, to a large extent, on the type of financing the company chooses to rely on – its capital structure. The company may rely either solely on equity or solely on debt, or use a combination of the two. The choice of financing makes the cost of capital a crucial variable for every company, as it will determine the company’s capital structure. Companies look for the optimal mix of financing that provides adequate funding and minimizes the cost of capital. In addition, investors use the cost of capital as one of the financial metrics they consider in evaluating companies as potential investments."

  "Explain the importance of meeting and exceeding customer/guest expectations": {
    "Answer:": "If customers are receiving exceptional customer service, they would naturally have a tendency to return to the same store/restaurant again to fulfill future needs. Although the customer may only spend a small amount in any given transaction, their loyalty is potentially worth thousands of dollars in profits to the company — which helps secure future employment for the team. \n\nTherefore, exceeding customer’s expectations is in the best interest of all employees at all times. Here are 3 key reasons why investing in exceptional customer service is an investment in your long term success.\n\nDifferentiates you from your competition \nCustomer service should exceed expectations because it may be the only factor that separates you from your competitors. Your products and prices may be the same. Your hours of operation and location may be the same. The quality of your products may also be the same. So it’s the things you do differently that will make you stand out from other businesses in the eyes of your customers. Be different in as many positive ways as possible. Be memorable for the right reasons. Your team should be cheerful when dealing with all customers, no matter what sort of day they have had. Handle customer complaints in a positive manner. Make the effort to go the extra mile at every opportunity so people are more than satisfied with your service. They are so delighted with your service experience that they wouldn’t dream of going elsewhere. Word of mouth is the cheapest, yet most powerful form of advertising available.\n\nCreates loyal customers \nYour end goal should be to gain as many loyal customers as possible because they’re priceless. Exceeding their expectations on a regular basis is the best way to satisfy them and retain their loyalty. Customers don’t want the stress of looking for new places to shop. If you provide excellent customer service at every opportunity, they’re more likely to keep coming back because you’re making life easier for them. Loyal customers are much easier to service because they’re more forgiving if there are the occasional problems because generally they’re satisfied with your service. It’s five times harder to win a new customer than it is to service your existing customer base so it’s essential that your team builds long-lasting relationships with your customers so they do remain loyal. It’s easy to become complacent when dealing with loyal customers if they’re simply coming in and spending their money. It’s vital that your team remain ever-vigilant to customer needs. \n\nWord of mouth is powerful \nIf your customer service experience exceeds expectations, that’s a powerful reason for customers to tell family and friends about your company’s service. People trust personal recommendations and are more likely to try a new business rather than go through the stress of shopping around for better prices. If the new customers are equally impressed with your service, they’re also more likely to refer you to their friends and so it continues like a domino effect, thereby increasing your profitability even more without excessive additional expenses. Even if you have a situation when a problem arises, this can be turned into an exceptional experience. This gives your team the opportunity to really demonstrate your service experience by the careful handling of the situation (more on this in our next article) and a positive result for the customer. Even then, any word of mouth advertising is bound to be positive. Word of mouth is the cheapest, yet most powerful form of advertising available. The faster it spreads, the better it is for your business. People will talk about your service experience — so it is important that the conversation is positive."

  "Explain the importance of merchandising to retailers.": {
    "Answer:": "The first important step in retail merchandising is establishing working relationships with manufacturers who will provide the goods or services that are ultimately sold by the retailer. This type of retail buying involves determining what products will be carried in the retail establishment, negotiating the unit price that will be charged by the manufacturer, and arranging for the delivery of those goods. Depending on the number of units the retailer can afford to purchase at a given time, it may be relatively easy to obtain a discounted unit price, making it easier for the retailer to be competitive in the local marketplace. \n• For a business to make sales, its products and services should be visible and displayed in an appealing manner, a process referred to as merchandising. \n• Merchandising includes product display and packaging, as well as all the advertising techniques used to promote and sell goods to consumers. \n• Good merchandising drives visitors to your store \n• Pricing, proper product display, packaging, promotional marketing and sales signs can shoot sales upwards and give the customers a memorable shopping experience \n• Good merchandising involves the proper arrangement of aisles, display fixtures, shelves and the entire layout of the retail space. \n• Offering fresh product arrangements in appealing displays entices shoppers to return frequently, building long-term loyal customer relationships."

  },
  "Explain the nature and scope of distribution.": {
    "Answer:": "Distribution channels are the series of marketing entities through which goods and services pass on their way from producers to end users. Distribution systems focus on the physical transfer of goods and services and on their legal ownership at each stage of the distribution process. While a distribution channel may seem endless at times, there are three main types of channels, all of which include the combination of a producer, wholesaler, retailer, and end consumer. The first channel is the longest because it includes all four: producer, wholesaler, retailer, and consumer. A distribution channel (also called a marketing channel) is the path or route decided by the company to deliver its goods or services to the customers. The route can be as short as a direct interaction between the company and the customer or can include several interconnected intermediaries like wholesalers, distributors, retailers, etc. \n\nHence, a distribution channel can also be referred to as a set of interdependent intermediaries that help make a product available to the end customer. In order to understand the importance of distribution channels, you need to understand that it doesn’t just bridge the gap between the producer of a product and its user. Distribution channels provide time, place, and ownership utility. They make the product available when, where, and in which quantities the customer wants. But other than these transactional functions, marketing channels are also responsible to carry out the following functions: \n\nLogistics and Physical Distribution: Marketing channels are responsible for assembly, storage, sorting, and transportation of goods from manufacturers to customers. \nFacilitation: Channels of distribution even provide pre-sale and post-purchase services like financing, maintenance, information dissemination and channel coordination. \nCreating Efficiencies: This is done in two ways: bulk breaking and creating assortments. Wholesalers and retailers purchase large quantities of goods from manufacturers but break the bulk by selling few at a time to many other channels or customers. They also offer different types of products at a single place which is a huge benefit to customers as they don’t have to visit different retailers for different products. \nSharing Risks: Since most of the channels buy the products beforehand, they also share the risk with the manufacturers and do everything possible to sell it. \nMarketing: Distribution channels are also called marketing channels because they are among the core touch points where many marketing strategies are executed. They are in direct contact with the end customers and help the manufacturers in propagating the brand message and product benefits and other benefits to the customers."

The term can also refer to a company's acquisition of long-term assets such as real estate, manufacturing plants and machinery. Capital investment is a broad term that can be defined in two distinct ways: \n1. An individual, a venture capital group or a financial institution may make a capital investment in a business. A sum of money is handed over as a loan, or in return for a promise of repayment or a share of the profits down the road. In this sense of the word, capital means cash. \n2. The executives of a company may make a capital investment in the business. They buy long-term assets that will help the company run more efficiently or grow faster. In this sense, capital means physical assets. \n\nIn either case, the money for capital investment must come from somewhere. A new company might seek capital investment from any number of sources, including venture capital firms, angel investors and traditional financial institutions. The company uses the capital to further develop and market its products. When a new company goes public, it is acquiring capital investment on a large scale from many investors. An established company might make a capital investment using its own cash reserves, or seek a loan from a bank. If it is a public company, it might issue a bond in order to finance capital investment. There is no minimum or maximum capital investment. It can range from less than $100,000 in seed financing for a start-up, to hundreds of millions of dollars for massive projects undertaken by companies in capital intensive sectors such as mining, utilities and infrastructure. Capital investment is meant to benefit a company in the long run, but it nonetheless can have short-term downsides. \n\nSpecial Considerations: A decision by a business to make a capital investment is a long-term growth strategy. A company plans and implements capital investments in order to ensure future growth. Capital investments generally are made to increase operational capacity, capture a larger share of the market, and generate more revenue. The company may make a capital investment in the form of an equity stake in another company's complementary operations for the same purposes. \nDisadvantages of Capital Investment: The first funding option for capital investment is always a company's own operating cash flow, but that may not be enough to cover anticipated costs. It is more likely the company will resort to outside financing to make up for any internal shortfall. \n\nCapital investment is meant to benefit a company in the long run, but it nonetheless can have short-term downsides. Intensive, ongoing capital investment tends to reduce earnings growth in the short term, and that is never a popular move among stockholders of a public company. Moreover, the total amount of debt a company has on the books is a figure closely watched by stock owners and analysts."

It is used to create a unique image of the product to help customers differentiate between competing products. If a customer is satisfied with a product, branding is important in helping the customer remember to buy that specific product again.\n• In an ever-competitive world, branding is one way of helping you increase sales and at the same time protect and extend the uniqueness of your service or product. Your uniqueness is the very reason why it’s important to develop your brand, and your brand is not your logo.\n• Your brand helps customers and prospects, understand and remember what’s unique about you. It tells your story and helps attract new customers and keep the ones you already have. Your brand is the definition that identifies your business, and makes specific promises: Walmart’s brand is about saving money (Save Money, Live Better). Mazda’s brand is about having fun while driving (Zoom-zoom).\n• Branding is just as important for small business as for large ones. For example, there are hundreds of coffee shops in Vancouver, several per block in some neighbourhoods. Why do some thrive while others fail? Is the coffee better? Is the atmosphere friendlier? Is the service faster? Is the price lower? Is one the go-to location for business meetings, where another is the neighbourhood hang-out? A good brand speaks clearly to its audience about the nature of the product or service, and the people behind it.\n• A well-branded business knows the one or two things it’s best at, and uses those to create a brand message. A good brand: delivers its message clearly, confirms the credibility of the message, connects to its audience emotionally, motivates the buyer, and reinforces loyalty.\n• A brand isn’t “different for the sake of being different.” A strong brand is clearly differentiated by its own unique story."

  "Explain the nature of short sales": {

They can be a risky strategy, as the potential losses on a short sale are theoretically unlimited, as the price of the securities could rise indefinitely.\nShort sales are subject to specific regulatory requirements, and may not be suitable for all investors.

They provide businesses with a way to raise capital by issuing securities such as stocks or bonds, which can be purchased by investors.\nIn this way, capital markets play a crucial role in business finance by providing companies with access to a larger pool of capital than they could raise from individual lenders or investors. This can be particularly important for larger companies that need to raise significant amounts of capital to fund growth or expansion.\nThere are two main types of capital markets: primary markets, where securities are initially issued and sold to investors, and secondary markets, where securities that have been previously issued can be bought and sold by investors.\nSome examples of capital markets include stock exchanges, bond markets, and venture capital markets. These markets can be accessed through financial intermediaries such as investment banks or brokerages, which facilitate the issuance and sale of securities to investors.\nIn summary, capital markets play a vital role in business finance by providing companies with a way to raise capital and fund growth and expansion. They also provide investors with opportunities to purchase securities and potentially earn a return on their investment."

  "Explain the types of business ownership": {
    "Answer:": "There are essentially 4 types of business ownership: sole proprietorship, partnership, corporation and co-operative.\n\nSole Proprietor – you are the sole owner, and fully responsible for all debts and obligations related to your business. All profits are yours to keep. Because you are personally liable, a creditor can make a claim against your personal assets as well as your business assets in order to satisfy any debts. \nAdvantages: \n• Easy and inexpensive to register\n• Regulatory burden is generally light\n• You have direct control of decision making\n• Minimal working capital required for start-up\n• Some tax advantages if your business is not doing well (e.g. deducting your losses from your personal income, and a lower tax bracket when profits are low)\n• All profts go to you directly\nDisadvantages:\n• Unlimited liability (if you have business debts, claims can be made against your personal assets to pay them off) \n• Income is taxable at your personal rate and, if your business is profitable, this could put you in a higher tax bracket \n• Lack of continuity for your business if you are unavailable\n• Can be difficult to raise capital on your own\n\nPartnership – A partnership is a non-incorporated business that is created between two or more people. In a partnership, your financial resources are combined with those of your business partner(s), and put into the business. You and your partner(s) would then share in the profits of the business according to any legal agreement you have drawn up.\nIn a general partnership, each partner is jointly liable for the debts of the partnership. In a limited partnership, a person can contribute to the business without being involved in its operations. A limited liability partnership is usually only available to a group of professionals, such as lawyers, accountants or doctors.\nWhen establishing a partnership, you should have a partnership agreement in place. This is important because it establishes the terms of the partnership and can help you avoid disputes later on. Hiring a lawyer or other legal professional to help you draw up a partnership agreement will save you time and protect your interests.\nAdvantages:\n• Fairly easy and inexpensive to form a partnership\n• Start-up costs are shared equally with you and your partner(s)\n• Equal share in the management, profits and assets\n• Tax advantage — if income from the partnership is low or loses money (you and your partner(s) include your shares of the\npartnership in your individual tax returns) \nDisadvantages:\n• There is no legal difference between you and your business\n• Unlimited liability (if you have business debts, personal assets can be used to pay off the debt)\n• Can be difficult to find a suitable partner\n• Possible development of conflict between you and your partner(s)\n• You are held financially responsible for business decisions made by your partner(s); for example, contracts that are broken\n\nCorporation - Incorporation can be done at the federal or provincial/territorial level. When you incorporate your business, it is considered to be a legal entity that is separate from its shareholders. As a shareholder of a corporation, you will not be personally liable for the debts, obligations or acts of the corporation. It is always wise to seek legal advice before incorporating.\nAdvantages:\n• Limited liability\n• Ownership is transferable\n• Continuous existence\n• Separate legal entity\n• Easier to raise capital than it might be with other business structures\n• Possible tax advantage as taxes may be lower for an incorporated business\nDisadvantages:\n• A corporation is closely regulated\n• More expensive to set up a corporation than other business forms\n• Extensive corporate records required, including documentation filed annually with the government\n• Possible conflict between shareholders and directors\n• You may be required to prove residency or citizenship of directors\n\nCo-operative - A co-operative is owned and controlled by an association of members. It can be set up as a for-profit or as a not- for-profit organization. This is the least common form of business, but can be appropriate in situations where a group of individuals or businesses decide to pool their resources and provide access to common needs, such as the delivery of products or services, the sale of products or services, employment, and more.\nAdvantages:\n• Owned and controlled by its members\n• Democratic control (one member, one vote)\n• Limited liability\n• Profit distribution\nDisadvantages:\n• Longer decision-making process\n• Participation of all members is required in order to succeed\n• Possible conflict between members\n• Extensive record keeping\n• Less incentive to invest additional capital"

  "Explain the types of economic systems": {
    "Answer:": "The world’s economic systems fall into one of four main categories: traditional economy, market economy, command economy and mixed economy; however, there are unlimited variations of each type. An economic system must define what to produce, how to produce it and for whom to produce it.\n• Traditional – A traditional economic system is one in which each new generation retains the economic position of its parents and grandparents. Traditional economies rely on the historic success of social customs. South America, Asia and Africa support some traditional economies of thriving agricultural villages. Tradition decides what an individual does for his living, so industry, clothing and shelter are the same as in previous generations.\n• Market – Market economies are based on consumers and their buying decisions rather than under government control.\nMarket trends and product popularity generate what businesses produce. The producers choose how to make products based on the most economically sound decision: that might mean machine labour to save costs or human labour for specific skills. The buyers decide who gets which products by what they are willing to pay for what they want.\n• The market system relies on many factors to ensure its success. The profit motive or incentive for a financial reward for enterprise stimulates production. Information regarding available products and services needs to be available to producers and consumers. Producers use the information to set accurate prices and procure supplies at the lowest cost. Price relates directly to the costs and benefits of product creation and use and required profit.\n• Command – In a command economy, the government controls all economic activity. One example of a command economy is communism. In a government-directed economy, the market plays little to no role in production decisions. Command economies are less flexible than market economies and react slower to changes in consumer purchasing patterns and fluctuations in supply and demand.\n• Mixed – A mixed economy combines qualities of market and command systems into one. In many countries where neither the government nor the business entities can maintain the economy alone, both sectors are integral to economic success. Certain resources are allocated through the market and others through the state. Theoretically, this system should be able to combine the best policies of both systems, but in practice the proportion government controls and response to market forces varies. Some countries rely more on market emphasis and others on state planning."

  "Explain the use of brand names in selling": {
    "Answer:": "Don’t confuse branding with advertising. Advertising is how you call attention to a brand. Branding is how you make an impression in the minds of your customer. Typically, a branding campaign consists of three elements:\n1) The Brand itself.\nThis is the perception that already exists in your customer’s mind. It is a combination of recognition, experiences and promises. You can find out a lot about your brand through simple research. Ask, who are my clients? What is the one thing for which I am known? A brand is: “The intangible sum of a product’s attributes: its name, packaging, and price, its history, its reputation, and the way it’s advertised.”\n2) The Brand Strategy.\nThis is simply known as positioning. If you are known for everything, you are known for nothing. Don’t try to be all things to all people. It is irrefutable that the fastest growing companies today are the ones with a narrow focus. You must have a razor sharp position in the marketplace. Every brand should come with a promise. What does your brand stand for? As you position your brand, it will pay off in several ways. The most important is that your name will begin to be associated with your specialty. In addition, your advertising will become better focused, as you will know exactly who to target.\n3) The Brand Identity.\nThis is every visual expression of the brand, be it in print, television or the kid in the blue shirt that helps you pick out videos. One of the fastest ways to build brand identity is through the careful application of graphic design. First, the graphics must reflect the company’s positioning strategy. Second, the graphics must be appropriate to the targeted customer. And last, the graphics must be consistent. The key to marketing a brand image is the consistent use in all markets. This includes the packaging, the colors, and the product’s total image. Does this mean that every marketing piece has to be exactly the same? No, quite the contrary. In fact, it is just as important that the graphics stay fresh and consistent with the market. This is especially important when the market is a young audience. A well-designed branding campaign will establish consistent branding elements, while leaving room for flexibility. Through careful brand management, Coca-Cola’s look today is as fresh as it ever was. Packaging used to be redesigned every five years. Today the average package life cycle is two or three years.\nIf your brand stands for a promise, if your communications are integrated, then you will begin to build a relationship with your customers. While they are filtering out the barrage of imagery that comes their way, they will also seek out your brand."

  "Explain the use of celebrities/influencers as a WOM strategy": {
    "Answer:": "It's not a new idea in marketing; celebrity endorsements sell products. And while not all brands subscribe to the celebrity endorsement theory, it's based in pretty simple logic. People idolize celebrities, so when famous people are seen in advertisements promoting a new product, audiences are prompted to buy that product, either subliminally or directly.\nThere are methods to fine tune the effectiveness of endorsements, however, that lead to bigger impact. Here's a look at how brands can use celebrities to boost their sales:\n\nThe Effects of Endorsements on Sales and Loyalty:\nThe potential positive effects on product sales cannot be understated. According to a study just one endorsement can spell an increase in sales by 4%, almost immediately. That's why businesses, even small businesses would be foolish to resist the mere exploration of celebrity influencers to promote their brand. The effects would be substantial if the brand could find a prominent name who influences their audience. When it comes to affecting brand loyalty one study found that while the use of celebrity endorsers does not necessarily influence consumer brand loyalty celebrity, \"endorsements are a powerful and useful tool that magnifies the effect of a campaign.\" \n\nCelebrities Inspire Consumer Confidence:\nThe brand value added by celebrities is immediate and palpable. When a celebrity signs an endorsement deal with a product, an element of legitimacy is suddenly present in the company, simply because of the power of the name backing it up.\nAccording to a study, a brand that inks an endorsement contract with a celebrity or an athlete can see their stock rise up to .25 as soon as the news is made public. This represents an increase in perceived legitimacy from the celebrity's endorsement, even though the product has not changed at all. The same study claims that on average, audiences are exposed to some 3,000 advertisements today across all media, leading to an element of marketing overexposure. Studies have shown that advertisements that use a celebrity, about whom many people already have positive feelings and impulses, grab an audience's attention more easily than a standard ad."

  "Explain the use of feedback for personal growth": {
    "Answer:": "The term ‘feedback’ is used to describe the helpful information or criticism about prior action or behavior from an individual, communicated to another individual (or a group) who can use that information to adjust and improve current and future actions and behaviors. Effective feedback, both positive and negative, is very helpful.\nFeedback occurs when an environment reacts to an action or behavior. For example, ‘customer feedback’ is the buyers’ reaction to a company’s products, services, or policies; and ’employee performance feedback’ is the employees’ reaction to feedback from their manager – the exchange of information involves both performance expected and performance exhibited. \nAll can benefit from feedback. Both common sense and research make it clear – feedback and opportunities to use that feedback helps to improve and enhance, whether an individual, group, business, business unit, company, or organization – and that information can be used to make better informed decisions. It also allows us to build and maintain communication with others. Feedback is valuable information that will be used to make important decisions. \nEffective feedback has benefits for the giver, the receiver, and the wider organization. Here are five reasons why feedback is so important. \n• Feedback is always there. If you ask someone in your organization when feedback occurs, they will typically mention an employee survey, performance appraisal, or training evaluation. In actuality, feedback is around us all the time. Every time we speak to a person, employee, customer, vendor, etc., we communicate feedback. In actuality, it’s impossible not to give feedback. \n• Feedback is effective listening. Whether the feedback is done verbally or via a feedback survey the person providing the feedback needs to know they have been understood (or received) and they need to know that their feedback provides some value. When conducting a survey, always explain why respondents’ feedback is important and how their feedback will be used.\n• Feedback can motivate. By asking for feedback, it can actually motivate employees to perform better. Employees like to feel valued and appreciate being asked to provide feedback that can help formulate business decisions. And feedback from client, suppliers, vendors, and stakeholders can be used to motivate to build better working relations\n• Feedback can improve performance. Feedback is often mistaken for criticism. In fact, what is viewed as negative criticism is actually constructive criticism and is the best find of feedback that can help to formulate better decisions to improve and increase performance.\n• Feedback is a tool for continued learning. Invest time in asking and learning about how others experience working with your organization. Continued feedback is important across the entire organization in order to remain aligned to goals, create strategies, develop products and services improvements, improve relationships, and much more. Continued learning is the key to improving."

  "Identify emerging compensation issues.": {

In addition to being competitive with the external market, pay must be equitable internally within the organization. Companies generally want to reward high performers with more money and try to create pay differences between employees in the\nsame job to recognize outstanding performance. However, HR must be mindful that it's against the law to pay employees who perform the same work differently solely because, for example, the employee is female or over 40.\n• Recognizing and rewarding employees. HR professionals design programs to successfully motivate employees to perform at their best and that recognize and reward employees for their contributions in a way that's affordable to the company.\n\nHowever, ultimately, it's the supervisors and managers in a company who recognize and reward employees, and compensation staff must train and educate managers on how to use rewards and recognition to make employees feel appreciated by the company and happy in their job."

If you're familiar\nwith the service blueprint, this is where so many of them focus because the arrival stage is both an easy time to delight a guest\nand an easy time to disappoint them. You can think of the guest life cycle as the four stages a guest goes through when lodging at a property – before they arrive in\nthe hotel, when they arrive, while they're staying, and after they've departed.\nComprehensively, the guest life cycle involves the following stages:\n· Research\n· Booking\n· Pre-stay\n· Arrival\n· Occupancy\n· Check-out\n· Post-stay\nIn each of these stages, you have an opportunity to provide excellent customer service, delighting your guest.\n\nDuring the pre-arrival stage, the guest is choosing the hotel and makes their reservation. Here you want to provide valuable information to the guest, convincing them that staying with you is the best decision. Ensure the reservation process is easy. When the guest arrives, the front office staff will check them in and ensure they get to their room smoothly. If you're familiar with the service blueprint, this is where so many of them focus because the arrival stage is both an easy time to delight a guest and an easy time to disappoint them. Removing service failure points in this stage is essential.\nWhen a guest is staying with you that’s the occupancy part of the guest life cycle. Here the guest is physically on your property. They may make guest requests, but they may not. They may post charges to their room (telephone, internet, etc.) or take advantage of your facilities.\nFinally, the guest will check out. As they depart your hotel the experience should be smooth and very easy. The front desk should collect guest feedback and use that to improve operations. Once the guest has left there is an opportunity to stay in touch, hoping to entice the guest to come back, give referrals, or perhaps even buy something from the gift shop. There is a lot of opportunity here for earning additional revenue. Mapping out the guest life cycle as we have can seem rather self-evident. It’s not a trite exercise, however, as the next step is to detail each and every action a guest has to take (and that your staff have to take) during each stage.\nOnce you have a list you can eliminate failure points and add in activities that should be happening. As you fill in these gaps you increase your own revenue by doing a better job and additionally provide superior levels of guest satisfaction. If something is notably difficult for a guest – say using your booking engine – then take the time to simplify the process.\nThe guest life cycle is a powerful model which is why it’s so commonly used in hospitality management."

    "Answer:": "Effective use of social media can bring great opportunities for your business but will require some thought and planning. Moving with fast-paced developments in online technology can help to enhance your brand, boost your profile and perhaps even win new business. However, you need a healthy perspective on what your business is able to put into social media, and what's realistic to expect in return.\nSocial media opportunities for business:\nHome computers, laptops, tablets, smartphones, and even internet-enabled televisions mean people can easily access the web from anywhere at any time. Faster connections, new devices and new online applications have all helped to change the way people work, socialize and shop.\n\nIt is now easier than ever for businesses to:\n· directly target customers with marketing campaigns\n· promote new products or services\n· build brand awareness\n· personally interact with existing and potential customers\n· measure referrals from your social media activity to sales\n\nSocial media can be a cheap and effective way of starting a marketing campaign, with a big impact possible from minimal investment. Your social media strategy should contain a smart mix of engaging content and a friendly and responsive 'persona' that can grow a focused community which is interested in your product/service/brand and can recommend your business to others. Social media should be incorporated into your public relations (PR) strategy. PR means getting people to talk and think about your business in a positive way. Social media provides a platform for your customers to talk with each other. How you manage that platform and engage with what your customers are saying is an important part of your PR strategy.\nSocial media challenges for business\nThere are so many social media tools and platforms it can be hard to know where to begin. For small businesses the key\nissue is resources - if you don't have someone able to manage a social media campaign, it can be a drain on your time and a potential distraction from your core business. Some of the main challenges to consider are:\n· What do you hope to achieve by using social media?\n· How much time you can devote to social media?\n· What are the most effective platforms to use?\n· What are you trying to achieve for your business?\n\nWhile social media gives you the chance to build brand awareness and customer loyalty, there are also dangers in\nparticipating in a public conversation forum. You need to have a clear idea of how to handle negative feedback about your\nbusiness. You need to ensure that what you post and how you interact with people present a professional image to the\nworld. Writing down a set of rules for how you will manage social media can help you to steer through the challenges - see\nhow to develop a social media strategy. It's important to consider the legal implications and best practices of using social media in order to avoid problems. Business use of social media has also raised customer expectations. They now expect immediacy in their online interactions - where content is regularly updated and any comments they make are quickly replied to. You should consider how these expectations will be managed."

It should be relatively easy to use the same suppliers for all locations. The bigger and more flexible issue will involve consistent presentation.\n\nIn the case of a restaurant each cook usually develops their own particular “touch” with the food they are preparing, and extensive training or rigid guidelines will have to be in place to ensure consistent quality among locations.

It’s always best to ask for the things you need at the beginning, rather than getting stuck halfway through because you haven't planned it out, and having to ask them for additional resources. Projects can’t start without: \n\n• People: Human resources are required to get the project done. Even if it’s just you. Normally a project team is a group of\npeople and you won't be working alone.\n• Capital: Your project needs money because it will need to pay for things, even if that is only your salary\n• Material Goods: Projects also use up assets. Assets, or goods, vary from project to project but it’s highly likely that your\nproject will need some kind of tangible resource. It’s normally what you use the project budget to buy.\nResources of all types are important to get your project off the ground and successfully moving in the right direction. The more effort put into thinking through the types of project resources you need and requesting them far enough in advance to ensure that they are ready for you when you need them, the easier it will be for you to complete your project on time, on budget and to the required specifications."

    "Answer:": "• Create traffic and keep the ordering process under three clicks\n• Bid on targeted, descriptive keywords and use a keyword selection tool like Google’s AdWords Keyword Tool to research targeted keywords that attract maximum traffic for minimal cost-per-click.\n• Submit or suggest your site to the organic search engines to make sure that the \"spiders\"--automated programs that crawl the web indexing sites for the search engines--find your site and include it in the search results.\n• Give away free content to other websites. Even just two or three well-written articles can generate truckloads of traffic, as long as they don't contain a sales pitch. You want to include rare, hard-to-get information that'll lend your articles automatic value--the kind of information that establishes you as an expert in your field.\n• Get free word-of-mouth publicity using viral marketing. Encourage people to pass on information about your site to\nothers and you use that word-of-mouth publicity to advertise your business.\n• Get free links on other high-traffic websites. Link requests require minimal effort from you, but a featured link on a major site in your industry can absolutely explode your traffic numbers quickly.\n• Affiliate programs--also referred to as \"reseller\" or \"associate\" programs--are a great way to get other people (called\n\"affiliates\") to promote your product or service for you. For every paying customer, your affiliates refer to your site by using\nbanner ads, text links, letters of referral and so on, and you pay them a commission. You track these referrals using special\nsoftware.\n• Use email marketing to attract repeat visitors. Begin collecting visitors' contact information from day one using an\nopt-in form on your home page. Then send them email messages to follow up and keep them thinking about your site, such as:\n   • Monthly or bi-weekly newsletters that include tons of tips and information\n   • Free reports on topics your market would appreciate\n   • Answers to common questions people ask about your product\n   • Offers for products similar or complementary to ones you may have already offered them\n   • Free product trials that give potential customers a taste of what you have to offer\n   • A \"downgrade\" offer for a product that's less expensive or robust than your featured offer\nOne of the biggest challenges we face as marketers is attracting the right traffic to our website. Most people think the important part of this sentence is \"traffic\". They believe any traffic is good traffic, no matter who it is. But this is the wrong way of thinking. While bigger numbers make us feel like our marketing is working, it's more important that we look at additional numbers like visitor-to-lead conversion rates and lead-to-customer conversion rates. Because what it all comes down to is this: is your marketing generating business results?\n\nIdentify Your Buyer Personas: who are your ideal customers? who are you marketing to? what are their pain points /\nchallenges?\nDevelop a Persona-Driven Keyword Strategy: search algorithms have changed, and you will see that finding keywords that are relevant to them are clearer. What phrase would they type into a search bar to find the solutions? These are going to be part of your keyword strategy. Once you've pulled together a list of keywords, you can start mapping out your content strategy. Assign keywords to your blog posts, content offers, campaigns, web pages, etc.\nStart Blogging: Now that you know who you are targeting and what keywords you're going to use so they can find you, it's time to start putting this into action and developing content. Blogging is a great way to drive qualified traffic to your website because Google in particular looks at when a site was last updated as it shows them the site is still active and relevant and Blogging fixes that. Each time you write a new blog post, you're adding additional content to your site, and one more page is getting indexed by search engines. Google in particular looks at when a site was last updated as it shows them the site is still active and relevant. Additionally, each blog post provides another opportunity for you to get found in search. And since your keywords are aligned to your personas, the traffic you're attracting will be the people you want.\nGet active on Social Media: Promoting your content on social media is a way to drive traffic to your website. Social media is a place where sharing is encouraged and more than likely, through social media promotion, your content will have a wider reach."

  "Identify strategies to manage customer experience during peaks in demand": {
    "Answer:": "What makes service industries so distinct from manufacturing ones is their immediacy: the hamburgers have to be hot, the motel rooms are exactly where the sleepy travellers want them, and the airline seats empty when the customers want to fly. Balancing the supply and demand sides of a service industry is not easy, and whether a manager does it well or not will make all the difference. If the capacity for taking orders has been increased without matching the capacity of staffing to meet those needs, the customer experience will fall.\n\nControlling Supply: The service manager has a more direct influence on the supply aspects of capacity planning than he or she does on the demand side. There are several things a service manager can do to adjust capacity to fluctuating demand.\n\nUsing part-time employees: Many service companies have found that it is more efficient to handle demand whenever it occurs than it is to attempt to smooth out the peaks. The peaks vary by type of business—during certain hours of the day, during certain days of the week, during certain weeks of the month, and during certain months of the year. These service businesses usually maintain a base of full-time employees who operate the facility during non-rush periods but who need help during peak periods. One of the best-known resources is part-time labour pools, especially for high school and college students, parents who desire to work during hours when their children are in school, and moonlighters who desire to supplement their primary source of income.\n\nMaximizing efficiency: Many service managers analyze their processes to discover ways to get the most out of their service delivery systems during peak demand periods. In effect, such analyses enable the service company to increase its peak capacity for little additional cost. For example, during rush periods employees perform only the tasks that are essential to delivering the service. If possible, managers use slack periods for doing supporting tasks, which in essence they are inventorying for peak periods. To maximize efficiency, managers examine even peak-time tasks to discover if certain skills are lacking or are inefficiently used. If these skills can be made more productive, the effective capacity of the system can be increased. Even rearranging the layout of the service delivery system can have a major impact on the productivity of the providers of the service. Another way to attack the peak capacity constraint is by cross-training. The service delivery system is composed of various components. When the system is delivering one service at full capacity, some sections of the system are likely to be underused. If the employees in these sections are able to deliver the peak service, they add capacity at the bottleneck. When the demand shifts and creates a bottleneck in other components of the system, the employees can shift back again.\n\nIncreasing consumer participation: The more the consumer does, the lower the labour requirements of the producer. Bag-'em yourself groceries, salad bars at restaurants, self-service gas pumps, customer-filled-out insurance information forms, and cook it- yourself restaurants are all examples of increased consumer participation in the production of services.\nThere are, of course, some risks to increasing consumer input: consumers might reject the idea of doing the work and paying for it too; the manager’s control over the delivery of the service is reduced, and such a move can create competition for the service itself. Customers can add their own sugar and cream.\n\nSharing capacity: The delivery of service often requires the service business to invest in expensive equipment and labour skills that are necessary to perform the service but that is not used at full capacity. In such cases, the service manager might consider sharing capacity with another business to use required, expensive, but underused resources jointly."

  "Identify the elements of the promotional mix": {
    "Answer:": "The combination of personal selling, advertising, sales promotion, direct marketing and public relations make up the promotional mix. Each plays a vital role in promoting businesses and their products.\n\n• Personal Selling – Personal selling requires that a company employ sales representatives who generate and maintain direct contact with prospects and customers. It is one of the costliest forms of promotion. Direct contact can take the form of personal meetings, telemarketing, email contact and correspondence.\n\n• Advertising – is a form of non-personal promotion. Companies pay to promote ideas, goods or services in a variety of media outlets. Advertising can be found everywhere from magazines, newspapers, televisions and websites to gymnasiums and city buses. With advertising, a company engages in one-way communication with the prospect or customer.\n\n• Sales promotion – represents all marketing activities – other than personal selling, advertising and public relations that are used to stimulate purchasing and sales. The objectives of sales promotions are to increase sales, inform potential customers about new products and create a positive business or corporate image.\n\n• Direct marketing – advertising directed to a target group of prospects and customers rather than to a mass audience. The two forms of direct marketing are printed direct mail, which is information sent via regular mail to a home or business and electronic direct mail. The goals of direct marketing are to generate sales or leads for sales representatives to pursue. Generally, direct marketing generates a response from the targeted customer i.e. special offer coupon. Direct marketing gives recipients an incentive to respond.\n\nPublic Relations and Publicity\n• Public Relations (PR) – activities enable an organization to influence a target audience. Often public relations campaigns try to create a favourable image for a company, its products, or its policies. However, companies can rely on public relations strategies and techniques for many reasons. One of the goals of a public relations program is to cultivate media relations with reporters who cover a specific industry. One of the most important media tools is the news release. A news release is an announcement that is sent to the appropriate media outlets.\n\n• Publicity involves bringing news or newsworthy information about an organization to the public’s attention. This process is known as placement. The main function of publicity is to develop a positive perception or awareness of the organization in the marketplace. The right kind of publicity can create and maintain a company’s image; negative publicity can devastate it. People like to do business with respectable companies. Placement of publicity is free. A news story on the evening news is free while advertising can cost thousands of dollars. News reporters are usually viewed as more objective than advertisers. The disadvantage is that you cannot control the content of publicity."

Early adopters are the consumers who will purchase the goods so marketing should be focused on these trendsetting consumers. Advertising in downtown offices and nearby businesses, advertising on the building itself, using social media where possible, as well as the more traditional advertising in trade magazines, attract the early adopter.\n• Growth - Customer awareness is limited but growing quickly at this stage as the item is new."

  "Identify the impact of product life cycles on operating decisions.": {
    "Answer:": "The product life cycle (PLC) has a significant impact on operating decisions made by a company. The PLC is the stages that a product goes through from its introduction to its withdrawal from the market. Each stage has its own set of operating challenges and opportunities, and companies must make different decisions based on the stage in which their product is currently in. During the introduction stage, companies focus on building a customer base and establishing a market for the product. In the growth stage, companies focus on expanding the business and increasing production and distribution. During the maturity stage, companies focus on maintaining market share and maximizing profits. In the decline stage, companies focus on phasing out the product and finding new products to replace it."

  "Identify ways that technology impacts business.": {
    "Answer:": "• Speed and Efficiency Workers today are more productive than they’ve ever been. The impact of technology on work, both in manufacturing and in communication, has exponentially increased the rate of production and speed at which business occurs. Technology in the workplace has helped workers become more efficient than ever before. What used to take hours now can take minutes. Messages can be sent instantly to colleagues or clients across the world. Payments or proposals can be transferred almost immediately. You can even automate follow-ups or entire customer-service conversations using simple AI messaging tools. \n• Technology Is Changing Office Culture Since technology in the workplace has made it both possible and practical to work remotely, companies have needed to create incentives to keep workers happy and drawn to the office. Otherwise, why have an office at all? Besides open offices, companies like WeWork have popularized co-working spaces as places where freelancers can have a place to work when they have no designated office space.\n• No More Need to Live Where You Work The biggest impact of technology in the workplace is the actual workplace itself. While most jobs still require you to clock-in and work onsite, there are plenty of open positions for telecommuters looking to work remotely at similar companies all over the country. \n• Working With Technology In the Gig Economy Gigging, the process of jumping from job to job or taking on multiple freelance jobs at one time, is growing in popularity. You can now hire contractors on a job-to-job basis with the touch of a few buttons and pay them entirely online. This makes starting and managing a small business easier in some ways, but harder in others, like controlling accountability or the availability of your workers. \n• Technology Creating Growing Pains Separating workers by screens creates miscommunication. Being glued to your email disrupts productivity. Automated voicemails can make customers upset. \n• Difficulty Detaching From Work Even with the greater flexibility allowed by working from home or freelancing in the gig economy, in some cases workers are working longer hours, well beyond their work day, over the weekend or even while sick. This mentality doesn’t result in better work; in fact, it leads to burnout, lack of sleep and even mild depression. When workers can’t disconnect, it affects their performance, as the stress from always being in work mode diminishes their results."

  "Identify ways to segment hospitality and tourism markets.": {
    "Answer:": "\"Proper market segmentation allows a hotel to price and apply inventory controls in order to maximize revenue from various lines of business. In order to be as successful as possible, hotel management must ensure that they use the most logical method possible for tracking their business.\" Hospitality market segments can focus on three key areas: product, pricing, and distribution. The need for market segmentation is more prominent in the hospitality industry now due to the rapid changes in customer needs and the vast amount of product offerings. With the lines blurring in respect to amenities and specific market offerings, segmentation has become a more complicated issue. Understanding some basic concepts will allow your hospitality operation to become more focused with attainable goals and measurable results. Your market segments can be evaluated using the following criteria: Segments must be identifiable so that they can be measured. Identifying a segment will also allow for greater reporting and more accurate tracking. Results will help in future decision making.\n• Segments must be accessible by communications and distribution channels. Evaluating a segment that is accessible will allow more flexibility in marketing budgets and cost of sales efforts.\n• Segments must be substantial so as to be profitable, and justify the resources required to obtain them and maintain them.\n• Segments must be durable to maintain stability of cost and impact to profits.\n\nOne facet of market segmentation in the hotel industry is the unique consumer segment. The idea of a unique consumer segment is relatively new in the industry, but may yield significant results. By identifying a unique consumer segment, a hotel can focus on and penetrate a non-traditional market. Project business can come in many forms and does not necessarily fit neatly into a traditional market segment. As long as the segments meet the above criteria it can become the basis on which targeted marketing and revenue management can prosper. Establish the foundation for segmentation in the unique consumer market by using the following categories:\n• Geographic - region, size, population, and climate.\n• Demographic - age, gender, lifestyle, income, occupation.\n• Psychographic - activities, social interest, values.\n• Behavioral - features, benefits, usage, loyalty, and occasion.\n\nUnique consumer segments can be vastly different. Take the time to ensure that the specific consumer that you are reaching is one that is matched most closely to your specific offering. Matching that customer will ensure more profitability and less effort. Retaining that customer may take constant review of your product and pricing as it relates to your competition. Establishing the basis of segmentation in the corporate market utilizes some similar components as the unique consumer market, but may have vast differences in the process involved in obtaining that specific account. Here are a few areas to focus on:\n• Location or cluster of industry.\n• Corporate type, size, industry, purchasing criteria.\n• Behavioral characteristics, usage, buying status. Keep in mind that corporate markets will take greater effort to obtain and maintain. Obtaining that customer will take longer as\nthere may be more requirements or additional decision makers to present to. Keeping that target corporate customer will take additional expense that will be far less than the expense to gain or regain that account.\n\nOther markets can be defined using the same components with differing sub-components or variables specific to that market. Understanding your customer segments to satisfy their needs will help you stand out among the competition and potentially create a specific niche market to target along with more efficiently using marketing resources. Once your marketing segmentation is in place, the real work begins. Sales and Marketing can begin to plan a targeted campaign for each segment along with creative sales efforts to engage the customer in the product, services and specific amenities you have to offer. Utilize all of the current methods of marketing strategies in todays electronic world to reach that segment. Ensure that return on investment is measured while calculating the proposed marketing expense. And follow up each marketing year to fine tune the segmentation to ensure that the customer criteria used in the past has not changed. Revenue management, on the other hand, can go about utilizing distribution channels targeted at customers in specific segments, ensuring that the proper product description and pricing is in place while allowing for proper tracking and reporting."

Cite any laws, studies conducted, customer feedback obtained or conventional business practices that\nreinforce the implementation of the business practice.\n• Involve customers in the interpretation of any business policy. Ask for candid feedback about how the rules impact their\nbusiness. For example, record input with online surveys using free software applications such as Qualtrics, Zoomerang or\nSurveyMonkey. Publish your findings so that customers can see that you have taken their feedback seriously and intend to\nact on their suggestions.\n• Propose an implementation date that allows the customer time to adjust to your new policy and enforcement of a current\npolicy.

  "Interpret financial statements.": {
    "Answer:": "Students should be evaluated on the concepts and principles involved in financial statement analysis\n• Fundamental analysis that should be given are questions pertaining to profitability and repayment of debt\n• Basically, the income statement shows how much money the company generated (revenue), how much it spent (expenses)\nand the difference between the two (profit) over a certain time period.\n• The income statement lets investors know how well the company’s business is performing - or, basically, whether or not\nthe company is making money.\n• Cost of goods sold is the expense most directly involved in creating revenue. It represents the costs of producing or\npurchasing the goods or services sold by the company.\n• Companies with high gross margins will have a lot of money left over to spend on other business operations, such as R&D\nor marketing. So be on the lookout for downward trends in the gross margin rate over time. This is a telltale sign of future\nproblems facing the bottom line. When cost of goods sold rises rapidly, they are likely to lower gross profit margins - unless,\nof course, the company can pass these costs onto customers in the form of higher prices.\n• High operating margins can mean the company has effective control of costs, or that sales are increasing faster than operating\ncosts. Operating profit also gives investors an opportunity to do profit-margin comparisons between companies that do not\nissue a separate disclosure of their cost of goods sold figures (which are needed to do gross margin analysis).\n• Operating profit measures how much cash the business throws off, and some consider it a more reliable measure of\nprofitability since it is harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than net earnings.\n• When a company has a high profit margin, it usually means that it also has one or more advantages over its competition.\nCompanies with high net profit margins have a bigger cushion to protect themselves during the hard times. Companies with low profit margins can get wiped out in a downturn. And companies with profit margins reflecting a competitive advantage\nare able to improve their market share during the hard times - leaving them even better positioned when things improve\nagain."

Make sure you use the same interview format and setting for every candidate, and that interview appointments are the same\nlength. Ideally, you should talk no more than 20% of the time. Use follow-up questions to have the candidate expand on their answers. Comment on what the candidate says to let them know you are interested and to encourage discussion.\n\nCheck the references of your final candidates Reference checks are a last opportunity to verify information the candidate has provided, validate their personal suitability and explore any areas of concern. Talk to references before you make an offer.\nLet the candidate know you will be doing this. Prepare a list of questions for. Ask about information on the candidate's resume and about topics discussed during the interview. Ask for insights into the candidate's character, examples of good work they\nhave done and areas that need development. If you keep the conversation casual but professional, you are likely to get more information."

  "Investigate suspected insurance fraud.": {},
  "Investigate ways that a negative credit report can affect a consumer’s financial options.": {
    "Answer:": "A low credit score, or negative credit report, will be due to problems paying when money is due. It could be due to a pattern of missed payments, chronically late payments, bankruptcy, foreclosures, repossessions, long overdue balances, etc.  Lenders know that the best predictor of future behaviour is past behaviour; the assumption is that if a person did not pay their debts in the past, they will not pay in the future (which may not necessarily be the case). \nPeople with low credit ratings are more likely to:\n• Be denied loans, mortgages and other contracted borrowing because they are a non-payment risk.  • Have higher interest rates than a person with a higher score \n• Be required to have a bigger share of the cost of the item (e.g., house downpayment) \n• Have difficulty renting a place to live \n• Not get security clearance at a job \n• Be charged higher insurance premiums \n• Have to buy their cell phone because they don’t qualify for a contract \n• Cause stress in close relationships \nWith a limited capacity to borrow, or a high interest cost to borrow, people may not be able to acquire the things they want when they want."

  "Justify reasons to have health insurance.": {
    "Answer:": "The purpose of health insurance is to help you pay for care. It protects you and your family financially in the event of an unexpected serious illness or injury that could be very expensive. The individual must assess whether the benefits of expanding coverage outweigh the costs for added services.\n• Outpatient care—the kind you get without being admitted to a hospital. ... Treatment in the hospital for inpatient care.\n• Critical Illness Insurance - A critical illness not only has a long-term impact on your life – it also affects your financial and retirement goals. Additional financial stress is the last thing someone recovering from a major health issue should face– that’s why critical illness insurance is one of the fastest growing sectors of the Canadian insurance market. If you do get diagnosed with a specified critical illness, your benefit is payable to you as a one-time lump sum payment – helping to alleviate the costs associated with medical treatment and recovery.\n• Hospital Stay Insurance - Illness and accidents can happen without warning. If you end up spending time in the hospital, you could be faced with unexpected medical costs not covered under your provincial health care plan. Ambulances, semi-private rooms, and everyday living expenses (baby sitting or housekeeping services, and travel to and from the hospital) often cost more than we expect. Hospital Stay Insurance provides you with up to $100 per day for each full day of hospitalization.\n• Health & Dental Insurance - While many provincial health plans cover major health costs that could affect the lives of Canadians, they may not cover items like prescription medication, physiotherapy, or dental hygiene. Without insurance protection, medicine and treatment from a medical or dental professional can become quite expensive. Supplementary health and dental insurance plans allow you to be sure that you’ll be able to provide for yourself or your family member should they fall ill. \n\nDo I need to purchase supplementary health insurance? That’s ultimately up to you, and depends primarily on your current financial situation. If you have more than enough money to cover the costs associated with a critical illness, accident, or hospital stay without dipping into your retirement savings, you probably don’t need additional health insurance. The majority of Canadians purchase supplementary health insurance as a way to help alleviate potential financial pressure should their life be affected by illness."

  "Lead change.": {
    "Answer:": "If you’re not willing to embrace change you’re not ready to lead. Put simply, leadership is not a static endeavor. In fact, leadership demands fluidity, which requires the willingness to recognize the need for change, and finally, the ability to lead change As much as some people want to create complexity around the topic of leading change, the reality is creating, managing and leading change is really quite simple. Companies that pursue and embrace change are healthy, growing, and dynamic organizations, while companies that fear change are stagnant entities on their way to a slow and painful death. It is the implementation of change which results in evolving, growing and thriving companies. \nIdentifying the Need for Change: The need for change exists in every organization. The most complex area surrounding change is focusing your efforts in the right areas, for the right reasons, and at the right times. The ambiguity and risk can be taken out of the change agenda by simply focusing on three areas: 1) Current Customers - what needs to change to better serve your customers? 2) Potential Customers…what needs to change to profitably create new customers? and; 3) Corporate Culture…what changes need to occur to better serve your workforce and improve their resources such that they can better influence items one and two above? \nLeading Change: There are four typical responses to change: The Victim; those who view change as a personal attack on their persona, their role, their job, or their area of responsibility. They view everything based upon how they perceive change will directly and indirectly impact them. The Neutral Bystander; This group is neither for nor against change. They will not directly or vocally oppose change, nor will they proactively get behind change. The Neutral Bystander will just go with the flow not wanting to make any waves, and thus hoping to perpetually fly under the radar. The Critic; The Critic opposes any and all change. Keep in mind that not all critics are overt in their resistance. Many critics remain in stealth mode trying to derail change behind the scenes by using their influence on others. Whether overt or covert, you must identify critics of change early in the process if you hope to succeed. The Advocate; The Advocate not only embraces change, they will evangelize the change initiative. Like The Critics, it is important to identify The Advocates early in the process to not only build the power base for change, but to give momentum and enthusiasm to the change initiative. Once you’ve identified these change groups you must involve all of them, and message properly to each of them. With the proper messaging and involvement even adversaries can be converted into allies. \nManaging Change: Managing change requires key players have control over 4 critical elements: 1) Vision Alignment - those that understand and agree with your vision must be leveraged in the change process. Those who disagree must be converted or have their influence neutralized; 2) Responsibility - your change agents must have a sufficient level of responsibility to achieve the necessary results; 3) Accountability - your change agents must be accountable for reaching their objectives, and; 4) Authority - if the first three items are in place, yet your change agents have not been given the needed authority to get the job done, the first three items won’t mean much. It's critical you set your change agents up for success and not failure by giving them the \nproper tools, talent, resources, responsibility and authority necessary for finishing the race."

  "Leverage data to recommend personalized, relevant campaigns.": {
    "Answer:": "Smart brands know that the more personalized they can make their messaging, the more likely a customer is to respond to it.

  "Maintain confidentiality in dealing with personnel.": {
    "Answer:": "Maintaining confidentiality in dealing with personnel refers to the responsibility to keep sensitive information about employees and the organization secure and not share it with unauthorized parties. Human resource professionals must understand the importance of maintaining the confidentiality of sensitive employee information, including Social Security numbers (US) or Social Insurance Numbers (Cdn), performance reviews, workplace injury reports, background checks, health-related information, pay levels, etc. Legal obligations, such as data-breach notification requirements and privacy laws (e.g., the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA), require employers to \nestablish processes and procedures to secure and safeguard sensitive employee data and notify employees of any breach of this confidential information.  \nIn addition to protecting sensitive employee information, HR must maintain confidentiality about management or business information that is not available to non-management employees or outsiders. Such information could include changing business strategies and processes, layoffs or plant closings, and proprietary data. \nConfidentiality is also critical in situations such as workplace investigations or performance and disciplinary actions. Maintaining confidentiality can be particularly challenging when certain information has to be divulged to others so that all involved parties can be heard and all pertinent information can be evaluated. In the case of a workplace investigation, an HR professional must be able to strike a balance between preserving employee confidentiality and completing a thorough investigation that is fair to all parties.  \nIt is not uncommon for an employee to present a workplace complaint but ask that no action be taken or that his or her name not be disclosed as the complainant. Although it is important to consider the employee's request, HR should not always promise confidentiality because of the responsibility to the employer to fully investigate employee complaints, especially if the concerns involve alleged discrimination, harassment or other legal issues. Disclosing important information to investigate a complaint can be critical in limiting employer liability and guarding against lawsuits. In these circumstances, HR can explain its obligation to fully investigate the concerns—not only for the benefit of the employee, but also for others who may be experiencing the same problem—while ensuring the employee that the information will be shared only with those who need to know and whose input is necessary to resolve the issue. \nPublic-sector employers may be subject to open-record/freedom-of-information laws that can impact the confidentiality of agency records. If you work for a public agency that is subject to these laws, consult your government’s specific legislation."

Use encryption software which changes the way information looks on the hard drive so that, without the correct password, it can't be read. \n• Secure your mobile phones - they hold so much data these days that they are like a company computer. Enable remote wiping. \n• Backup regularly (weekly is recommended)\n• Data-leakage prevention software, which is set up at key network touch points to look for specific information coming out of your internal network. It can be configured to look for credit card numbers, pieces of code, or any bits of information relevant to your business that would indicate a breach. \n• Be careful with links carrying viruses arriving by e-mail, IM and surfing the Web. \n• Educate your employees about safe online habits and a proactive defense."

  "Make decisions.": {
    "Answer:": "Students may select any of the choices available. Ensure that students explain WHY they have selected the given alternative Making a good informed decision is not that different to sitting on a jury – all reasonable doubt has to be removed before you can pass a verdict one way or the other. Thankfully, though, corporate decisions are seldom a matter of life or death! Don’t judge a book by its cover - You may be someone who’s big on first impressions when you meet people but you can’t let the same thought process influence your decision-making. If on first hearing an idea strikes you as a really good one, you may well be correct, but you mustn’t allow that first reaction to influence your ability to objectively weigh the cons as well as all the pros when they are presented. \nDo your homework - Just because no significant cons are presented it doesn’t mean they don’t exist, so get someone on to digging them up and evaluating them while you still have the time – discovering them after you’ve launched the deal doesn’t do you any favours. Insisting that this homework is conducted becomes doubly important if and when everyone is unanimously in favour of going ahead with the project. Nothing is perfect, so work hard at uncovering whatever hidden warts the thing might \nhave and by removing them you’ll only make it better still.\nAvoid making decisions in isolation - Every decision has some degree of impact on your ability to adopt other future opportunities in what the experts call ‘the decision stream’. This one may be a ‘too good to miss’ opportunity but how will it affect other projects or priorities and, if now is not the best time to do it, what risks if any are there in putting the thing on hold for an agreed period of time? If you cannot manage this project in addition to another that’s waiting in the wings, which one gets the nod and why? \nDo everything you can to protect the downside - All wise investors go to great lengths to do this with their stock portfolios and when setting up a new business you should try to employ the same strategies.  \nGive it time - If you have the time to use the ‘orchestrated procrastination’ approach then do so. Without getting into the ‘paralysis by analysis’ mode, doing more rather than less homework on a project is seldom a bad thing. While looking at it more deeply you may find better alternatives or the marketplace may change. Making smart informed decisions is why leaders get paid the big bucks. There is really no science to getting it right every time which is why (unfortunately) decision-making is not a process that can be programmed to come in ‘just in time’ across the board."

  "Model ethical behavior.": {
    "Answer:": "Generally speaking, employees know that they should never do certain things at work. Not every situation is so clear-cut, however, which is why it's important for employers to implement ethical codes of conduct. Although not all-inclusive, these codes will guide employees through the many \"gray areas\" of working life as they come up. The result is a consistent promotion of accountability, honesty, integrity and open communication, which are the key values of a healthy workplace. \nAccountability and Follow-up: A healthy workplace culture sets codes and standards for acceptable behavior, which managers reinforce through all levels of the organization. For new hires, the first exposure to the company's core values might come at orientation. To ensure that employees connect words and deeds, proactive companies implement follow-up procedures -- such as codes of conduct -- that outline the consequences for any violations. Managers should train employees to report unethical behavior, and follow up promptly when complaints surface. \nFair Allocation of Resources: Companies need to establish a link between ethical behavior and appropriate use of resources. Executive leaders have five key resources at their disposal: capital assets, information, money, people and time. Depending on how managers allocate these resources, different perceptions of equity and fairness may arise. Managers who make a point of trying to distribute all resources fairly are more likely to inspire appropriate ethical behavior among employees than those who pay lip service to the concept. \nOpen Communication: In a model ethical culture, managers expect employees to put what's right above their own interests and promote an atmosphere that encourages tolerance for people's views. The organization places a premium on open communication to accomplish its goals. Companies also emphasize that any self-serving actions -- such as intimidating\nemployees from reporting ethical lapses to management -- won't be accepted. Failure to check these tendencies creates a  divisive atmosphere that destroys trust and internal relationships. \nProtecting Company Assets: An ethical workplace encourages employees to take a consistent line on protecting company  assets, whether it's office supplies or an expense account that you're supposed to fill out honestly. When you see unethical  actions, such as supply thefts, you feel empowered to report them -- because such behavior isn't tolerated. Rather than writing  off such lapses as the cost of doing business, your employer shows that everyone will be held to the same standard. Respecting Company Time:Respect is a two-way street, particularly when it comes to your employer's time. You shouldn't  need a reminder that any personal Internet surfing at work is an ethics violation. Most employers have some type of policy to  prevent an addiction to gambling, news or social networking sites from disrupting the workplace. You also accept that  updating personal blogs, websites and social media accounts isn't sanctioned, unless it relates to your job."

  "Monitor drug and alcohol testing.": {
    "Answer:": "What should employers do if they suspect an employee is under the influence of drugs or alcohol at work? These steps are written with the assumption that the organization has a clearly written drug and alcohol policy that includes drug and alcohol testing for reasonable suspicion. A general policy statement is not enough to permit testing; if the policy does not include testing for reasonable suspicion, employers may want to consult their legal counsel to determine if this is a type of policy their organization should implement. \nStep 1: Receive Complaints \nConcerns that an employee is under the influence often come from co-workers or even clients or vendors before a supervisor or manager notices. Managers or HR professionals do not want to send an employee for testing based on hearsay or gossip, but they should document the complaint or concerns of co-workers who bring this information forward. Managers or HR professionals should take a few extra minutes to ask what the employee observed, when the employee observed it and if others witnessed or commented on this situation. The employer should also determine if the behavior is new or has happened in the past (possibly indicating a pattern of behavior). \nStep 2: Observe the Employee \nFirsthand observation should be made by two members of management. Immediately upon notice of this type of concern, the employee's supervisor, an available manager or HR personnel should go to this employee's work area for firsthand observation. The observer may be able to view the employee from afar, but usually he or she will need to talk with the employee directly to observe any smell of alcohol, eye dilation, slurred speech or other behaviors. The supervisor, manager or HR professional who performed the initial observation should seek a second member of management or HR to confirm initial suspicions. The second observer should perform his or her own firsthand observation of the employee. Step 3: Remove the Employee from Safety-Sensitive Areas\nIf the employee is working around machinery or heavy equipment or is in any other type of safety-sensitive job, or is acting  out in a way that appears to be a safety concern for the employee or others, managers or HR staff may need to immediately  remove the employee from the work area and ask him or her to wait in a conference room or an office. Step 4: Document Observations \nBoth observers should clearly document their observations, including any abnormal behaviors. The observers should be as  specific as possible in their descriptions but not attempt to diagnose the situation. For example, an observation may include: · Odors (smell of alcohol, body odor or urine). \n· Movements (unsteady, fidgety, dizzy). \n· Eyes (dilated, constricted or watery eyes or involuntary eye movements). \n· Face (flushed, sweating, confused or blank look). \n· Speech (slurred, slow, distracted mid-thought, inability to verbalize thoughts). \n· Emotions (argumentative, agitated, irritable, drowsy). \n· Actions (yawning, twitching). \n· Inactions (sleeping, unconscious, no reaction to questions). \nStep 5: Assess the Situation \nAfter the situation has been clearly documented, managers or HR staff need to assess what they know and observed to  determine next steps. If both observers witnessed behaviors that create a suspicion and the documentation supports this  suspicion, then managers or HR may proceed with Step 6. If there is disagreement, managers or HR may need to bring in a  third party to also observe and help make a determination. Managers or HR may decide that a reasonable suspicion of use of  drugs or alcohol does not exist and that no further action is necessary other than documentation of the complaint and  subsequent observations. \nStep 6: Meet with the Employee \nWhen reasonable suspicion testing is warranted, both management and HR should meet with the employee. Those leading the  meeting should clearly explain what has been observed and documented by management and that, in order to rule out the possibility that the employee is in violation of the company's drug and alcohol policy, the organization will send the employee for a drug or alcohol test. Explaining it in this manner shows the employee that the employer has not jumped to any  conclusions, but is simply following procedures, and if the employee is not under the influence of drugs or alcohol at work,  the test will prove this. If the employer has not obtained a drug testing consent previously, the manager or HR staff member  should have a consent form available at this meeting for the employee's signature. \nStep 7: Prepare Transportation \nEmployers should not allow employees suspected of being under the influence behind the wheel of a car; therefore, the  manager or HR should ensure the employee does not have to drive to the testing center or home afterward. Often employers  coordinate with a local cab company for these types of trips. The cab fees and tip should be paid by the employer. The  manager or HR will need to coordinate with the cab company or driver on whether the employer can be billed or must pay  upfront. It is a good idea to work out this arrangement in advance so that it is available when needed. Another option, if  feasible, would be to have a manager escort the employee to the testing center and drive the employee home afterward. Step 8: Send the Employee for Testing \nThe manager or HR should contact the drug test facility to advise that an employee is on the way for reasonable suspicion  testing. The employee should be given the number for the cab company to call after the testing to arrange a ride home. Step 9: Wait for Test Results \nThe employee needs to know what to do and expect the following day. Company policy should address this situation, but if  not, the employer should set a consistent practice. In most cases, the employer does not want an employee to return to work  until the test results are available. Employers are not obligated to pay a nonexempt employee for any time or days he or she  must spend off work waiting for test results; however, the employer may be required to pay exempt employees for this time  off work according to the Employment standards for your area. \nStep 10: Respond to Employee's Refusal to Take the Test \nIf the employee refuses to be tested, the employer should refer to its drug and alcohol policy. A policy may state that this  refusal will be treated as a positive drug test result or will result in immediate termination of employment. If the employee refuses a cab and attempts to drive home, the employer should never attempt to physically restrain the employee. The  organization should note the employee's type of car and license plate and contact the authorities to report concern that the  employee is driving under the influence. \nStep 11: Respond to Negative Test Results \nIf the drug or alcohol test results are negative, the manager or HR should contact the employee and return him or her to the  previous job and work shift as soon as possible. Many employers pay the employee for all work shifts and hours he or she  missed while waiting for the negative test results (even if the employee is not required to be paid). Step 12: Respond to Positive Test Results \nAgain, the employer must refer to its company policies and precedence. If the organization has an employee assistance  program (EAP), it is a good idea to provide contact information for this service regardless of whether the individual's  employment is continued. Depending on company policy, the employer may offer a last chance agreement allowing the  employee to seek counseling, treatment or both and return to work with the understanding that he or she will be terminated if under the influence at work again. An employer does have the option to terminate immediately for positive test results if this  is the employer's common practice, policy or precedence. Organizations may wish to seek legal counsel on how to proceed."

  "Perform responsibility center budgeting (i.e., cost, profit, investment, revenue).": {
    "Answer:": "Performing responsibility center budgeting refers to the task of creating a budget that is specific to a particular area or function of an organization, such as cost, profit, investment, or revenue.\nResponsibility centers are segments within a responsibility accounting structure. Five types of responsibility centers  include cost centers, discretionary cost centers, revenue centers, profit centers, and investment centers. Cost centers are  responsibility centers that focus only on expenses. \nResponsibility accounting is a basic component of accounting systems for many companies as their performance measurement process becomes more complex. The process involves assigning the responsibility of accounting  for particular segments of the company to a specific individual or group. These segments are often structured as  responsibility centers in which designated supervisors or managers will have both the responsibility for the  performance of the center and the authority to make decisions that affect the center. \nOften, businesses will use the segment structure to establish the responsibility accounting framework. You  might think of segments and responsibility centers as two sides of the same coin: segments establish the  structure for operational accountability whereas responsibility centers establish the structure for financial  accountability. Both segments and responsibility centers (which will likely be the same) attempt to accomplish  the same goal: ensure all sectors of the business achieve the organization’s strategic goals."

  "Persuade others.": {
    "Answer:": "• Use framing to influence thought. “The glass is half empty.” That’s how a pessimist would \"frame\" the objective fact of a half a glass of water. Framing is simply a way to alter how we will sort, categorize, associate and ultimately give meaning to events, objects or behaviours. \n• Use the mirroring technique. Mirroring is the practice of mimicking the movements and body language of the person you are trying to persuade. By acting as the person listening does, you create a sense of empathy. \n• Promote the scarcity of something. Scarcity is frequently used by advertisers to make opportunities seem more appealing because they have limited availability. The assumption is that if a product is scarce, there must be a ton of demand for it! • Use reciprocation to create an obligation. When someone does something for us, we feel compelled to return the favor. So, if you want someone to do something nice for you, why not do something nice for them first?\n• Use timing to your advantage. People are less likely to be agreeable and submissive when they're mentally fatigued. Before you ask someone for something they might not readily agree to, consider waiting until they've just done something mentally taxing. This could be at the end of the work day when you catch a co-worker on their way out the door. Whatever you ask, a likely response is, \"I'll take care of it tomorrow.\" \n• Use congruence to obtain a wanted outcome. We all try, subconsciously, to be consistent with previous actions. A technique used by salespeople is to shake your hand as he is negotiating with you. In most people's minds, a handshake equates to a closed deal, and by doing this before the deal actually closed, the salesperson is more likely to actually close it. \n• Use fluid speech. When we talk, we often use little interjections and hesitant phrases such as \"ummm\" or \"I mean\" and of course there is the ubiquitous \"like\". These little conversation fillers have the unintended effect of making us seem less confident and sure of ourselves, and thus less persuasive. \n• Use herd behaviour to influence a decision. We constantly observe to those around us to determine our actions; we have the need for acceptance. We are far more likely to follow or be persuaded by someone we like or by someone who we see as an authority. \n• Ask \"Yes\" Questions. Begin the conversation with questions that generate a \"Yes\" response. \"Nice day today, isn't?\" \"You're looking for a great deal on a car, aren't you?\" \n• Break the touch barrier. Whether you're closing a deal or asking someone on a date, touching them (in a subtle and appropriate way) can improve your chances by subconsciously activating the human desire to bond."

  "Place merchandise for impact.": {
    "Answer:": "The layout of a store is a significant factor for the maintenance of a thriving business, which can help advance sales and profitability. An effective store layout encourages consumers to shop the entire store and view an extensive assortment of merchandise. The most common forms of store layouts include grid layout, racetrack layout and free form layout. Choosing a store layout depends on the type of store and the nature of the product sold. A grid layout is generally organized in a rectangular shape, which allows customers to shop quickly and maximize shop floor space, ideal for a supermarket or hardware store. A acetrack layout ensures that the consumer only follows one path when browsing the store. This is beneficial in the sense that the consumer will come into contact with every product on the shelf. However, this can irritate customers. Customers may feel that they are being forced to follow a certain path, and can be frustrating when trying to make a quick purchase. Free form layout is a suitable layout for a store that encourages browsing. This type of layout is more relaxed in its structure, which leaves the customer feeling less rushed. The entrance of the store, otherwise known as the transition zone, is an important area in the store. This is an area where all shoppers pass on entry into store, and is significant as this zone is where consumers can observe the stimuli and sense the general vibe of the store. Therefore, thoughts and representations a consumer has about the store and the brand depend on this area. When customers enter the transition zone they need time to adjust to the new environment including the lighting, the temperature and other sights and sounds. Higher profit margin items aren’t recommended to be placed in that area because customers don't notice it while they are preoccupied with adjusting to the new environmental stimuli. Spatial design of a retail store is a key aspect when it comes to creating an enjoyable experience, and is also an effective way of communicating with customers. Colour can be considered as one of the most important variables when it comes to ambiance in retail. Certain colours that can be considered as highly arousing can encourage customers to make purchases out of impulse. Warm colors such and orange, red, and yellow give consumers a sense of excitement but also provide a sense of anxiety and create a distraction. Recreational shoppers that enjoy a sense of excitement may prefer these high arousal colors. . In general, people prefer cool colours such as green and blue and associate these colours with a sense of calmness and security. Shoppers who are more task oriented are more likely to prefer these cool colours as they bring this calming effect and are also less likely to distract them from the task at hand. The way the furniture such as shelves and racks and seating are set up is a tangible element is store design. A store layout with a higher regard for space can increase customer pleasure, and a store filled with clutter can have the opposite effect. . When It comes to a simple well-spaced layout in a store, task oriented customers find this type of layout to be the most effective, as they can easily locate the items they want without the unnecessary clutter and obstacles in their way. These simple factors can encourage customers to stay in the store longer and in turn spend more."

  "Plan product mix.": {
    "Answer:": "Planning product mix refers to the task of determining the types and quantities of products that will be sold in a store or business. In the case of a newly established, independently owned, fast food restaurant, the owner has already decided on the main categories of the product mix. Our job is to suggest the specific items. The main thing to keep in mind is that we are not selling a variety of different items, but rather a selection and collection of items that reinforce the image of healthy eating. Even the items we list on our menu can include terms like “low fat”, “diet”, “low calorie”, etc. The image is very important (we want to sell the sizzle, not the steak). The conditions established by the owner are to help reduce food waste. The general food categories have already been provided (fast, fresh sandwiches and soups, low-fat alternatives, some sides and beverages). Most of the customers would likely be people with average to higher incomes that have the ability as well as the desire to pay a little more in order to get what they want. This suggests we should try and get more “upscale” items. This is more likely with the soups. An example would be to have something like “Butternut Squash with Cinnamon”, instead of something that sounds plainer."

  "Plan project.": {
    "Answer:": "Step 1: Identify & Meet with Stakeholders - It's important to remember that stakeholders aren't only the people who hired you to manage the project; a stakeholder is anyone who's affected by the results of your project. That includes your customers and end users, too. Make sure you identify all stakeholders and keep their interests in mind when you create your project plan. Meet with the project sponsors and key stakeholders to discuss their needs and expectations, and establish baselines for project scope, budget, and timeline. Then create a Scope Statement document to finalize and record the details of the project scope, get everyone on the same page, and reduce the chances of costly miscommunications. Here's a Scope Statement Template to get you started. \nStep 2: Set & Prioritize Goals - Once you have a list of stakeholder needs, prioritize them and set specific project goals. These should outline the objectives of the project — the benefits you hope to accomplish. Write out your goals (and the stakeholder need met by each one) in your project plan so it's clearly communicated and easily shared. \nStep 3: Define Deliverables - Identify the deliverables you need to produce in order to meet the project's goals. What are the specific products you're expected to complete?\nNext, estimate due dates for each deliverable in your project plan. (You can actually finalize dates when you sit down to define your project schedule in the next step.) \nStep 4: Create the Project Schedule - Look at each deliverable and define the series of tasks that need to be completed in order to accomplish each one. For each task, determine the amount of time it will take, the resources necessary, and who will be responsible for its completion. \nNext, identify any dependencies. Do certain tasks need to be completed before others can begin? Input deliverables, dependencies, and milestones into your Wrike Gantt chart, or choose from the many online templates and apps available. Step 5: Identify Issues and Complete a Risk Assessment - No project is risk-free, and you won't do yourself any favors by crossing your fingers and hoping for the best. Are there any issues that you know of upfront that will affect your project, like a key team member's upcoming vacation? What unforeseen circumstances could create hiccups? (Think cold & flu season, backordered parts, or technical issues.) \nConsider the steps you could take to either prevent certain risks from happening, or limit their negative impact. Conduct a risk assessment and develop a risk management strategy to make sure you're prepared. \nStep 6: Present the Project Plan to Stakeholders - Explain how your plan addresses stakeholders' expectations, and present your solutions to any conflicts. But make sure your presentation isn't one-sided; it should be a discussion. You'll need to determine roles: who needs to see which reports, and how often? Which decisions will need to be approved, and by whom? \nCommunicate clearly. Make sure stakeholders know exactly what's expected of them, and what actions they're responsible for. Just because it's obvious to you, doesn't mean it's obvious to them."

  "Predict (possible) consequences of excessive debt.": {
    "Answer:": "Besides the below financial consequences of excessive debt, you need to consider the personal consequences which include high stress, health issues, self esteem, relationship problems. \nLimits purchasing power Obviously, spending power with a credit card can be increased, which, to some, is the point of having a credit card. While it does increase spending, if the balance is not paid off eventually the credit card will become more of an expense and less of a supply of extra money. When this tilting point is reached, purchasing power is reduced. Income starts going toward paying interest and paying down the principal. Depending on how much debt you have, this could be a significant reduction in discretionary income. You cannot afford to not make payments on your debt because that will put you in an even worse position next month. If you miss too many payments, you could be foreclosed on or have your car repossessed. Debt can reach a point that it dictates what you do with your paycheck. \nLimits financial flexibility Changes in your life, your job location, your job, your family all have an effect. If you are in debt excessively, your choices are always limited by the money you owe. Debt can prevent you from improving your life because you won’t be able to take those chances or risks of missing out on the income you already have and depend on. Limits choices At first, it may start as not being able to buy that extra present during the holidays. Then, maybe you have to cut back on how often you go out to eat, but a home cooked meal never hurt anyone. Eventually though, it may escalate to the point that you can’t afford to go out and get the newer car, despite really needing it. You might be bound by not being able to afford to make a large purchase so you repair your older car. Hopefully, it doesn’t break down like you expect it to do. Maybe your debt gets to the point that you have to move to a cheaper area to regain some of the spending capabilities you lost when the bills started piling up. We all want to have the option to get something better. If we get into debt trouble our choices could be made for us."

Firewalls prevent unwanted visitors from entering a computer system to use files, gain personal information or destroy computer data. A good firewall should be part of a company’s computer system. \n• Allow employees access to information which is job related only – block everything else. Any file that contains a credit card or client number, for instance, can be automatically tagged with restrictions that encrypt it when it's put on a USB drive. Or, if that same information is shared within a company, the applicable rules might prevent those who see it from cutting and pasting any of the names and addresses. \n• Monitor data as it flows in and out of networks--including through USB ports, e-mail, file transfer protocol and Web browsers. Also monitor data leaving a company's network, blocking the movement of sensitive data or encrypting it. • Install software that classifies data by modeling their movement and watching for anomalies that might be signs of penetration or insider misbehaviour. \n• Simple and effective internal threat management procedures can help prevent employee information leaks from happening to the bank. This will protect the company’s most confidential and valuable information from being exposed to unauthorized parties \n• Be aware of where critical corporate data is located and who has access to the data \n• Develop an acceptable use policy for all employees that outlines appropriate use of corporate assets, information and intangible assets. This policy should outline company procedures when a violation takes place \n• Consistently enforce policies and procedures and revise as required\n• Ensure there is an internal incident response plan and that the appropriate resources are available in-house to handle information loss or access by unauthorized employees or outsiders."

  "Recognize and respond to ethical dilemmas.": {
    "Answer:": "The nature of ethical dilemmas is that the ‘‘right thing to do’’ is not immediately or even eventually clear. These dilemmas are problems because their resolution is neither simple nor easy and they must be confronted under time pressures as well as conflicting financial and political demands. Often the ‘‘right answer’’ comes with a price tag. Moreover, in many instances, the crucial factors underlying the dilemma are not immediately obvious. So, how can individuals better resolve these dilemmas and reduce their chance of making a mistake that they will later regret? As in many areas of life, we often fail in ethics, not because we don’t know the right answer, but rather fail to ask the right questions. To tackle ethical dilemmas and avoid making ethical mistakes, executives, managers, and professionals can use the following five questions, which, while they will not guarantee making the right decision, can help prevent making the wrong one. They are: \n• What are my self-interests in this situation and how might they influence me? Self-interests are a natural part of human nature. They are neither necessarily good nor bad but should be acknowledged so as to prevent you from doing something unethical. \n• What are the interests of others and the larger society and to what extent should I take them into consideration? What would lead to the greatest good for the greatest number and to what extent should that be my predominant criterion in this situation?\n• What principles and values, laws and regulations, policies and procedures, or socially appropriate behaviors do I need to consider? Are the relevant principles or processes more important than outcomes? Am I willing to apply those same principles to myself regardless of the personal consequences? \n• In my job or role, my personal or professional relationships, or as a member of the larger society, what are my obligations to others? How should the principle of reciprocity apply? Are my obligations sufficiently important that I would be willing to sacrifice my self-interest, a fundamental principle or the greater good? \n• What is in my long-term best interest and that of society in general, and how can I simultaneously meet both those commitments? Where do my long-term interests and those of others intersect, and is there a decision or action that might satisfy both? \nThe challenge, having asked these five questions and considered their implications, is to understand and minimize any inherent conflicts among the values and obligations that they underscore. This can be addressed by focusing on three criteria for resolving such value conflicts primacy, balance and acceptance. Primacy asks, ‘‘Which questions are most relevant to the values that are important to you and your organization in this situation?’’ Balance encourages seeking the best tradeoff if you must compromise among values. Acceptance asks, ‘‘How well will your decision and its underlying rationale likely hold up under public scrutiny?’’"

  "Recognize/Reward others for their efforts and contributions.": {
    "Answer:": "Every employee working at your workplace – from a simple technician to a richly experienced manager expects you to recognize his/her work and appreciate the efforts he/she puts in day after day for the success of your business. Employee recognition and rewarding is a process through which employers or business owners make a conscious effort to reward and award your employees not just to acknowledge their work but also to motivate them to continue with the same passion. \nEmployee recognition is the acknowledgment of an employee’s efforts, hard work and behavior at the workplace that have contributed to the organization’s success and objectives in some way. Both things are very important: recognizing and acknowledging these efforts, as well as rewarding employees for their fruitful efforts. Here are some ways in which you as an \nemployer or business owner can recognize the efforts of your workplace and reward them accordingly: Day-to-day recognition – It is important to motivate and encourage employees to perform well on an everyday basis and not just on a periodic level. For example, small words of praise, little words of encouragement and constant motivation are highly important to make your employees feel encouraged for their efforts and to maintain a positive flow of the workplace environment. Informal recognition – Informal recognition is the kind of recognition which includes gestures of encouragement and appreciation. A pat on the back or a word of praise in front of the team can go a long way in boosting the morale of the employees. Formal recognition – Formal recognition is usually in the form of rewards for service, contribution, and achievements. These recognition forms also include events held for the celebration of achievements. Formal recognition often has some legal and policy requirements. \nSome forms of rewards are recognition (a plaque, certificate, company newsletter etc), promotion, a gift, or cash incentives which might include profit sharing."

  "Recommend actions that a borrower could take to reduce or better manage excessive debt.": {
    "Answer:": "Evaluate Your Debts Collect all of your financial documents and print out your free annual credit reports. Use your credit report and debt lists to see exactly where you stand. This is an important step toward debt recovery and one that people are often scared to take. On a piece of paper, write down the balances, interest rates, and monthly amount due for each of your debts.\nInclude your auto loans, personal loans, payday loans, credit cards, and other debts. You should also make note of any annual fees on your credit cards. You don’t need to include your mortgage loan or student loans at this time. These loans have relatively long terms and low APRs so it is better to focus on paying off your other debts first. \nLook at Your Budget After you have collected the information about your debts, you should take a look at your monthly budget. Write down your monthly income after taxes and subtract your rent/mortgage payment from this amount and other monthly expenses such as childcare, student loan payments, insurance, utilities, and groceries. Once you have subtracted all of your expenses, calculate how much you have left to pay off your debts. If this amount is too small, look for ways to reduce your spending. The more you can pay towards your debts each month, the sooner you will be debt free. \nMake a Plan Now that you know all about your financial situation, it’s time to create a plan for reducing your debts. Use your information from Step 1 and 2 to fill in the following chart. Subtract your minimum debt payments (Step 1) and monthly expenses (Step 2) from your monthly income after taxes. The remaining amount should be used to pay off the debt with the highest interest rate and the highest balance. \nContinue this cycle each month until the debt is paid off and then move on to the next highest rate/balance account. This may seem like an odd process, but it is the fastest way to reduce your debts. During this time, you should not add any new charges to your credit cards. Also, try to increase the amount you pay toward the most expensive debt each month. Track your progress with a chart like this:\nStart Negotiations While you are starting to follow your repayment plan from Step 3, you should contact your creditors and lenders to see if you can improve the terms on your debts. You may be able to lower your interest rates or negotiate a reduced settlement on some debts by speaking with the customer service department. It is especially easy to negotiate the terms of debts that are charged off (dismissed) by the creditor or in collections already. Also think about moving some of your credit card debts to new accounts with lower interest rates. Moving a balance to a credit card with a 0% introductory rate for 6-12 months can help you save a lot on interest. Just be sure to keep each of your credit card balances below 35% of the credit limits to avoid damaging your credit score. During this time, investigate if consolidating your debts into a personal loan or home equity loan could help too. \nFollow-Through Your Debt Reduction Plan Do your best to meet your repayment goals each month. It’s okay if the amount you put toward your most expensive debt each month varies. Just try to consistently put as much as possible toward your debts. Signing up for an automated payment system and keeping a chart of your progress on the refrigerator can help you stay on track. When you reach major milestones, be sure to celebrate your success. Before you know it, you’ll be debt free!"

  "Recommend ways to use social media safely.": {
    "Answer:": "Limit the amount of personal information you post - Do not post information that would make you vulnerable, such as your address or information about your schedule or routine. If your connections post information about you, make sure the combined information is not more than you would be comfortable with strangers knowing. Also be considerate when posting information, including photos, about your connections.\nRemember that the Internet is a public resource - Only post information you are comfortable with anyone seeing. This includes information and photos in your profile and in blogs and other forums. Also, once you post information online, you can't retract it. Even if you remove the information from a site, saved or cached versions may still exist on other people's machines. Be wary of strangers - The Internet makes it easy for people to misrepresent their identities and motives. Consider limiting the people who are allowed to contact you on these sites. If you interact with people you do not know, be cautious about the amount of information you reveal or agreeing to meet them in person. \nBe skeptical - Don't believe everything you read online. People may post false or misleading information about various topics, including their own identities. This is not necessarily done with malicious intent; it could be unintentional, an exaggeration, or a joke. Take appropriate precautions, though, and try to verify the authenticity of any information before taking any action. Evaluate your settings - Take advantage of a site's privacy settings. The default settings for some sites may allow anyone to see your profile, but you can customize your settings to restrict access to only certain people. There is still a risk that private information could be exposed despite these restrictions, so don't post anything that you wouldn't want the public to see. Sites may change their options periodically, so review your security and privacy settings regularly to make sure that your choices are still appropriate. \nBe wary of third-party applications - Third-party applications may provide entertainment or functionality, but use caution when deciding which applications to enable. Avoid applications that seem suspicious, and modify your settings to limit the amount of information the applications can access. \nUse strong passwords - Protect your account with passwords that cannot easily be guessed. If your password is compromised, someone else may be able to access your account and pretend to be you. \nCheck privacy policies - Some sites may share information such as email addresses or user preferences with other companies. This may lead to an increase in spam. Also, try to locate the policy for handling referrals to make sure that you do not unintentionally sign your friends up for spam. Some sites will continue to send email messages to anyone you refer until they join.\nKeep software, particularly your web browser, up to date - Install software updates so that attackers cannot take advantage of known problems or vulnerabilities. Many operating systems offer automatic updates. If this option is available, you should enableit. \nUse and maintain anti-virus software - Anti-virus software helps protect your computer against known viruses, so you may be able to detect and remove the virus before it can do any damage. Because attackers are continually writing new viruses, it is important to keep your definitions up to date."

And you're more likely to create this response by showing your supplier how important they are to your business. \nYou can find suppliers through a variety of channels: \n• Recommendations - ask friends and business acquaintances \n• Directories \n• Trade associations\n• Business advisors \n• Exhibitions \n• Trade press \nMake sure you know what you need. Don't be tempted by sales pitches that don't match your requirements. Understand the difference to your business between a strategic supplier, who provides goods or services that are essential to your business -such as high-value raw materials - and non-strategic suppliers who provide low-value supplies such as office stationery. You will need to spend much more time selecting and managing the former group than the latter. \n• Spend time on research \n• Ask around \n• Credit check potential suppliers \n• Price isn't everything - reliability and speed, for example \n• Agree on service levels before you start \n• Don't buy from too many suppliers - it will be easier for you to manage - and probably more cost-effective - if you limit the number of sources you buy from. This is particularly the case with low value-added suppliers. \n• ...but don't have just a single supplier – so you have an alternative supply source ready to help in difficult times"
